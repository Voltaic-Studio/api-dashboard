    "description": "### The Internet of Things for Everyone\n\nThe Adafruit IO HTTP API provides access to your Adafruit IO data from any programming language or hardware environment that can speak HTTP. The easiest way to get started is with [an Adafruit IO learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/adafruit-io-basics) and [a simple Internet of Things capable device like the Feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821).\n\nThis API documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages and is available at [https://github.com/adafruit/io-api](https://github.com/adafruit/io-api). For questions or comments visit the [Adafruit IO Forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=56) or the [adafruit-io channel on the Adafruit Discord server](https://discord.gg/adafruit).\n\n#### Authentication\n\nAuthentication for every API request happens through the `X-AIO-Key` header or query parameter and your IO API key. A simple cURL request to get all available feeds for a user with the username \"io_username\" and the key \"io_key_12345\" could look like this:\n\n    $ curl -H \"X-AIO-Key: io_key_12345\" https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds\n\nOr like this:\n\n    $ curl \"https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds?X-AIO-Key=io_key_12345\n\nUsing the node.js [request](https://github.com/request/request) library, IO HTTP requests are as easy as:\n\n```js\nvar request = require('request');\n\nvar options = {\n  url: 'https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds',\n  headers: {\n    'X-AIO-Key': 'io_key_12345',\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction callback(error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    var feeds = JSON.parse(body);\n    console.log(feeds.length + \" FEEDS AVAILABLE\");\n\n    feeds.forEach(function (feed) {\n      console.log(feed.name, feed.key);\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nrequest(options, callback);\n```\n\nUsing the ESP8266 Arduino HTTPClient library, an HTTPS GET request would look like this (replacing `---` with your own values in the appropriate locations):\n\n```arduino\n/// based on\n/// https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266HTTPClient/examples/Authorization/Authorization.ino\n\n#include <Arduino.h>\n#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>\n#include <ESP8266WiFiMulti.h>\n#include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h>\n\nESP8266WiFiMulti WiFiMulti;\n\nconst char* ssid = \"---\";\nconst char* password = \"---\";\n\nconst char* host = \"io.adafruit.com\";\n\nconst char* io_key = \"---\";\nconst char* path_with_username = \"/api/v2/---/dashboards\";\n\n// Use web browser to view and copy\n// SHA1 fingerprint of the certificate\nconst char* fingerprint = \"77 00 54 2D DA E7 D8 03 27 31 23 99 EB 27 DB CB A5 4C 57 18\";\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  for(uint8_t t = 4; t > 0; t--) {\n    Serial.printf(\"[SETUP] WAIT %d...\\n\", t);\n    Serial.flush();\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n\n  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n  WiFiMulti.addAP(ssid, password);\n\n  // wait for WiFi connection\n  while(WiFiMulti.run() != WL_CONNECTED) {\n    Serial.print('.');\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"[WIFI] connected!\");\n\n  HTTPClient http;\n\n  // start request with URL and TLS cert fingerprint for verification\n  http.begin(\"https://\" + String(host) + String(path_with_username), fingerprint);\n\n  // IO API authentication\n  http.addHeader(\"X-AIO-Key\", io_key);\n\n  // start connection and send HTTP header\n  int httpCode = http.GET();\n\n  // httpCode will be negative on error\n  if(httpCode > 0) {\n    // HTTP header has been send and Server response header has been handled\n    Serial.printf(\"[HTTP] GET response: %d\\n\", httpCode);\n\n    // HTTP 200 OK\n    if(httpCode == HTTP_CODE_OK) {\n      String payload = http.getString();\n      Serial.println(payload);\n    }\n\n    http.end();\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop() {}\n```\n\n#### Client Libraries\n\nWe have client libraries to help you get started with your project: [Python](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-python), [Ruby](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-ruby), [Arduino C++](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Arduino), [Javascript](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-io-node), and [Go](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-go) are available. They're all open source, so if they don't already do what you want, you can fork and add any feature you'd like.\n\n",

    "description": "Airbyte Configuration API\n[https://airbyte.io](https://airbyte.io).\n\nThis API is a collection of HTTP RPC-style methods. While it is not a REST API, those familiar with REST should find the conventions of this API recognizable.\n\nHere are some conventions that this API follows:\n* All endpoints are http POST methods.\n* All endpoints accept data via `application/json` request bodies. The API does not accept any data via query params.\n* The naming convention for endpoints is: localhost:8000/{VERSION}/{METHOD_FAMILY}/{METHOD_NAME} e.g. `localhost:8000/v1/connections/create`.\n* For all `update` methods, the whole object must be passed in, even the fields that did not change.\n\nAuthentication (OSS):\n* When authenticating to the Configuration API, you must use Basic Authentication by setting the Authentication Header to Basic and base64 encoding the username and password (which are `airbyte` and `password` by default - so base64 encoding `airbyte:password` results in `YWlyYnl0ZTpwYXNzd29yZA==`). So the full header reads `'Authorization': \"Basic YWlyYnl0ZTpwYXNzd29yZA==\"`\n",

AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices.</p> <p>To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid.</p> <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version. </p> <p>AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html\">AppConfig User Guide</a>.</p>",

    "title": "CodeArtifact",
    "description": "<p> CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache Maven, pip, and dotnet. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a package manager client. </p> <p> <b>CodeArtifact Components</b> </p> <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeArtifact components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Repository</b>: A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/welcome.html#welcome-concepts-package-version\">package versions</a>, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files. Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the <b> <code>npm</code> </b> CLI, the Maven CLI (<b> <code>mvn</code> </b>), Python CLIs (<b> <code>pip</code> </b> and <code>twine</code>), and NuGet CLIs (<code>nuget</code> and <code>dotnet</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Domain</b>: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a <i>domain</i>. All package assets and metadata are stored in the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in Key Management Service (KMS).</p> <p>Each repository is a member of a single domain and can't be moved to a different domain.</p> <p>The domain allows organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public repositories can be used as sources of packages.</p> <p>Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and share packages across their organization.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package</b>: A <i>package</i> is a bundle of software and the metadata required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact supports <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-npm.html\">npm</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-python.html\">PyPI</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-maven\">Maven</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-nuget\">NuGet</a> package formats.</p> <p>In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A <i>name</i> (for example, <code>webpack</code> is the name of a popular npm package)</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional namespace (for example, <code>@types</code> in <code>@types/node</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p>A set of versions (for example, <code>1.0.0</code>, <code>1.0.1</code>, <code>1.0.2</code>, etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p> Package-level metadata (for example, npm tags)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package version</b>: A version of a package, such as <code>@types/node 12.6.9</code>. The version number format and semantics vary for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning specification</a>. In CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier, metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Upstream repository</b>: One repository is <i>upstream</i> of another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client. CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two repositories.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Asset</b>: An individual file stored in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm <code>.tgz</code> file or Maven POM and JAR files.</p> </li> </ul> <p>CodeArtifact supports these operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>AssociateExternalConnection</code>: Adds an existing external connection to a repository. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CopyPackageVersions</code>: Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateDomain</code>: Creates a domain</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateRepository</code>: Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a domain. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteDomain</code>: Deletes a domain. You cannot delete a domain that contains repositories. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy</code>: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeletePackage</code>: Deletes a package and all associated package versions.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeletePackageVersions</code>: Deletes versions of a package.

    "description": "<p>CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility, serverless Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service.</p> <p>You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use CodeDeploy.</p> <p>CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual deployments.</p> <p> <b>CodeDeploy Components</b> </p> <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeDeploy components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Application</b>: A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. CodeDeploy uses this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment group</b>: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An Amazon EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment</b>: The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more instances. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application revisions</b>: For an Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.</p> <p> <b>CodeDeploy Information Resources</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide\">CodeDeploy User Guide</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/\">CodeDeploy API Reference Guide</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/index.html\">CLI Reference for CodeDeploy</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=179\">CodeDeploy Developer Forum</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

    "description": "<fullname>AWS CodePipeline</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">AWS CodePipeline User Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions.</p> <p> <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. </p> <p>You can work with pipelines by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which creates a uniquely named pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineExecution</a>, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListActionExecutions</a>, which returns action-level details for past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details, including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the execution, and input and output artifact location details.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelineExecutions</a>, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopPipelineExecution</a>, which stops the specified pipeline execution from continuing through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pipelines include <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html\">AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference</a>.</p> <p>Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i> that are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and <a>GetPipelineState</a>. Valid action categories are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Source</p> </li> <li> <p>Build</p> </li> <li> <p>Test</p> </li> <li> <p>Deploy</p> </li> <li> <p>Approval</p> </li> <li> <p>Invoke</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete.</p> <p>You can work with transitions by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline</b> </p> <p>For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:</p> <p> <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. </p> <p>You can work with jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns the details of a job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner Network.</p> <p>You can work with third party jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetThirdPartyJobDetails</a>, which requests the details of a job for a partner action.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForThirdPartyJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.</p> </li> </ul>",

It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/\">Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service FAQ</a>. Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your on-premises servers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agentless discovery</b> is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agent-based discovery</b> collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center.</p> <ul> <li> <p> The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization, and network dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p>The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions</b> integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or discovery agent.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Third-party application discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the public API.</p> </li> <li> <p>In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track migrations.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Recommendations</b> </p> <p>We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect additional information.</p> <p> <b>Working With This Guide</b> </p> <p>This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response.

    "description": "<fullname>Global Accelerator</fullname> <p>This is the <i>Global Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html\">Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>Global Accelerator is a service in which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits. </p> <ul> <li> <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the Amazon Web Services global network. </p> </li> <li> <p>For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example, specify <code>--region us-west-2</code> on AWS CLI commands.</p> </important> <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global Accelerator provides two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses and two static IPv6 addresses. With a standard accelerator for IPv4, instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring toGlobal Accelerator (BYOIP). </p> <p>For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions , which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one Amazon Web Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p> <important> <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html\">Tag-based policies</a>.</p> </important> <p>For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints.</p> <p>For more information about understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html\">Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an Amazon Web Services EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and responses, including errors.</p> <p>The API is an Amazon Web Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS HTTPS service endpoints, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html\">Amazon IVS page</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <i> <b>All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. </b> </i> </p> <p>For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/doc-history.html\"> Document History</a>.</p> <p> <b>Allowed Header Values</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code> <b>Accept:</b> </code> application/json</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <b>Accept-Encoding:</b> </code> gzip, deflate</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <b>Content-Type:</b> </code>application/json</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain information about your IVS live stream (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/getting-started.html\"> Getting Started with Amazon IVS</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Channel</b> — Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Stream key</b> — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey endpoints for more information. <i> <b>Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.</b> </i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Playback key pair</b> — Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Recording configuration</b> — Stores configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more information.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. A tag comprises a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category. See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html\">Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags and \"Tag naming limits and requirements\"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html\"> Access Tags</a>). </p> <p>The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording Configurations.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource. </p> <p> <b>Authentication versus Authorization</b> </p> <p>Note the differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. You need to be authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition, authorization is needed to view <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html\">Amazon IVS private channels</a>. (Private channels are channels that are enabled for \"playback authorization.\")</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Authentication</b> </p> <p>All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You generate a signature using valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission to perform the requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a signature generated from a user account that has the <code>ivs:PutMetadata</code> permission.</p> <p>For more information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures — See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html\">Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS permissions — See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html\">Identity and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p> <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies and API calls. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html\">Amazon Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <b>Channel Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateChannel</a> — Creates a new channel and an associated stream key to start streaming.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetChannel</a> — Gets the channel configuration for the specified channel ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>BatchGetChannel</a> — Performs <a>GetChannel</a> on multiple ARNs simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListChannels</a> — Gets summary information about all channels in your account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified name or recording-configuration ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409 Conflict Exception).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateChannel</a> — Updates a channel's configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take effect.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteChannel</a> — Deletes the specified channel.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>StreamKey Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateStreamKey</a> — Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetStreamKey</a> — Gets stream key information for the specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>BatchGetStreamKey</a> — Performs <a>GetStreamKey</a> on multiple ARNs simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListStreamKeys</a> — Gets summary information about stream keys for the specified channel.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteStreamKey</a> — Deletes the stream key for the specified ARN, so it can no longer be used to stream.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Stream Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>GetStream</a> — Gets information about the active (live) stream on a specified channel.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetStreamSession</a> — Gets metadata on a specified stream.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListStreams</a> — Gets summary information about live streams in your account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is processed.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListStreamSessions</a> — Gets a summary of current and previous streams for a specified channel in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopStream</a> — Disconnects the incoming RTMPS stream for the specified channel. Can be used in conjunction with <a>DeleteStreamKey</a> to prevent further streaming to a channel.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutMetadata</a> — Inserts metadata into the active stream of the specified channel. At most 5 requests per second per channel are allowed, each with a maximum 1 KB payload. (If 5 TPS is not sufficient for your needs, we recommend batching your data into a single PutMetadata call.) At most 155 requests per second per account are allowed.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>PlaybackKeyPair Endpoints</b> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html\">Setting Up Private Channels</a> in the <i>Amazon IVS User Guide</i>.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ImportPlaybackKeyPair</a> — Imports the public portion of a new key pair and returns its <code>arn</code> and <code>fingerprint</code>. The <code>privateKey</code> can then be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels (channels enabled for playback authorization).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPlaybackKeyPair</a> — Gets a specified playback authorization key pair and returns the <code>arn</code> and <code>fingerprint</code>. The <code>privateKey</code> held by the caller can be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPlaybackKeyPairs</a> — Gets summary information about playback key pairs.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeletePlaybackKeyPair</a> — Deletes a specified authorization key pair.

For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region\">Service endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All KMS requests must be signed with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/\">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html\">Amazon Web Services Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i> describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b> </p> <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>Encrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>Decrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKey</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

    "title": "AWS Lambda",
    "description": "<fullname>Lambda</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. For more information about the Lambda service, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html\">What is Lambda</a> in the <b>Lambda Developer Guide</b>.</p> <p>The <i>Lambda API Reference</i> provides information about each of the API methods, including details about the parameters in each API request and response. </p> <p/> <p>You can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For installation instructions, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>. </p> <p>For a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html/\">Lambda endpoints and quotas </a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference.</i>. </p> <p>When making the API calls, you will need to authenticate your request by providing a signature. Lambda supports signature version 4. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 signing process</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference.</i>. </p> <p> <b>CA certificates</b> </p> <p>Because Amazon Web Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list. </p> </li> <li> <p>Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later versions contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list. </p> </li> <li> <p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list. </p> </li> <li> <p>Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list. </p> </li> </ul> <p>When accessing the Lambda management console or Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or programmatically, you will need to ensure your client machines support any of the following CAs: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Amazon Root CA 1</p> </li> <li> <p>Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2</p> </li> <li> <p>Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority</p> </li> </ul> <p>Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from <a href=\"https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/\">Amazon trust services</a>, but keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about ACM-provided certificates, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/faqs/#certificates\">Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager FAQs.</a> </p>",

CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as \"NullReferenceException\"). You can also count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as \"404\" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Monitor CloudTrail logged events</b>: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform troubleshooting.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Archive log data</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage.

With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis and threat detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version 6.0.9. For information about Suricata, see the <a href=\"https://suricata.io/\">Suricata website</a>.</p> <p>You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways. The following are just a few examples: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the port used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/\">Amazon VPC User Guide</a>.</p> <p>To start using Network Firewall, do the following: </p> <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in Amazon VPC. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through the new firewall endpoints.</p> </li> </ol>",

You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.</p> <p> <b>Glossary of terms</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include <code>ChefAutomate</code> and <code>Puppet</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database.

Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete, even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended.</p> <p> <i>Idempotency</i> ensures that an API request action completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such as the current creation status.</p> <p>The following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure idempotency.</p> <p> <b>Idempotent create APIs with a client token</b> </p> <p>The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a <i>client token</i>. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you <i>don't</i> reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs.</p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.</p> <p>If you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Client tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with the expired token, a new resource is created.</p> <p>If the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is created.</p> <p>Idempotent create APIs with a client token:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateServiceTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent create APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource <i>hasn't</i> been modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.</p> <p>If the original resource has been modified, the retry throws a <code>ConflictException</code>.</p> <p>If you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Idempotent create APIs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateServiceTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateEnvironment</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateService</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent delete APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>When you retry the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its metadata is returned in the response.</p> <p>If you retry and the resource doesn't exist, the response is empty.</p> <p>In both cases, the retry succeeds.</p> <p>Idempotent delete APIs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteServiceTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteServiceTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, if the original request delete operation status is <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, the retry returns the resource detail data in the response without performing any further actions.</p> <p>If the original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty response.</p> <p>Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>DeleteEnvironment</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteService</p> </li> </ul>",

As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.</p> <p>This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.</p> <p> <b>Amazon RDS API Reference</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>For the alphabetical list of API actions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html\">API Actions</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For the alphabetical list of data types, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html\">Data Types</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For a list of common query parameters, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html\">Common Parameters</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For descriptions of the error codes, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html\">Common Errors</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon RDS User Guide</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces\">Available RDS Interfaces</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For more information about how to use the Query API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Using_the_Query_API.html\">Using the Query API</a>.</p> </li> </ul>",

Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule.

    "description": "Our atmosphere protects us from a hostile space radiation environment comprising high energy particles of solar and intergalactic origin. Solar radiation is significant during unpredictable and short lived solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs); however, galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is omnipresent. The GCR intensity varies with latitude, longitude, and time due to effects of solar activity on the interplanetary magnetic field, as well as the Earth's magnetic field. Space radiation collides with gases in the atmosphere, leading to a complex shower of high energy radiation, the intensity and composition of which varies spatially and temporally. Excessive exposure to radiation can damage DNA and lead to long-term health effects such as an increased risk of cancer.  <br><br> Resulting radiation levels at commercial aircraft altitudes are greater than at sea level. Aircrew are classified as radiation workers in some countries; however, planning to limit their exposure, and monitoring, is generally lacking. Both real-time measurements and predictive models of radiation in the atmosphere are important to mitigate the radiation risk to crew. <br><br>\nWe host a RESTful API to models of cosmic ray induced ionising radiation in the atmosphere. \nThe CARI7 and PARMA endpoints use models developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration and the Japan Atomic Energy Agency to  calculate cosmic radiation doses at a point. \nThe Route Dose API calculates the same quantities along a great circle route between two airports using CARI7. <br><br>\nAPI requests must contain a key \"API-Key\" in the header (see code samples).

    "description": "# Overview\n\nTo facilitate management, Apache Airflow supports a range of REST API endpoints across its\nobjects.\nThis section provides an overview of the API design, methods, and supported use cases.\n\nMost of the endpoints accept `JSON` as input and return `JSON` responses.\nThis means that you must usually add the following headers to your request:\n```\nContent-type: application/json\nAccept: application/json\n```\n\n## Resources\n\nThe term `resource` refers to a single type of object in the Airflow metadata. An API is broken up by its\nendpoint's corresponding resource.\nThe name of a resource is typically plural and expressed in camelCase. Example: `dagRuns`.\n\nResource names are used as part of endpoint URLs, as well as in API parameters and responses.\n\n## CRUD Operations\n\nThe platform supports **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete operations on most resources.\nYou can review the standards for these operations and their standard parameters below.\n\nSome endpoints have special behavior as exceptions.\n\n### Create\n\nTo create a resource, you typically submit an HTTP `POST` request with the resource's required metadata\nin the request body.\nThe response returns a `201 Created` response code upon success with the resource's metadata, including\nits internal `id`, in the response body.\n\n### Read\n\nThe HTTP `GET` request can be used to read a resource or to list a number of resources.\n\nA resource's `id` can be submitted in the request parameters to read a specific resource.\nThe response usually returns a `200 OK` response code upon success, with the resource's metadata in\nthe response body.\n\nIf a `GET` request does not include a specific resource `id`, it is treated as a list request.\nThe response usually returns a `200 OK` response code upon success, with an object containing a list\nof resources' metadata in the response body.\n\nWhen reading resources, some common query parameters are usually available. e.g.:\n```\nv1/connections?limit=25&offset=25\n```\n\n|Query Parameter|Type|Description|\n|---------------|----|-----------|\n|limit|integer|Maximum number of objects to fetch.

It is used to notify the\nAPI which fields you want to update. Using `update_mask` makes it easier to update objects\nby helping the server know which fields to update in an object instead of updating all fields.\nThe update request ignores any fields that aren't specified in the field mask, leaving them with\ntheir current values.\n\nExample:\n```\n  resource = request.get('/resource/my-id').json()\n  resource['my_field'] = 'new-value'\n  request.patch('/resource/my-id?update_mask=my_field', data=json.dumps(resource))\n```\n\n## Versioning and Endpoint Lifecycle\n\n- API versioning is not synchronized to specific releases of the Apache Airflow.\n- APIs are designed to be backward compatible.\n- Any changes to the API will first go through a deprecation phase.\n\n# Trying the API\n\nYou can use a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/),\n[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [the Insomnia rest client](https://insomnia.rest/) to test\nthe Apache Airflow API.\n\nNote that you will need to pass credentials data.\n\nFor e.g., here is how to pause a DAG with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), when basic authorization is used:\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://example.com/api/v1/dags/{dag_id}?update_mask=is_paused' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--user \"username:password\" \\\n-d '{\n    \"is_paused\": true\n}'\n```\n\nUsing a graphical tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/),\nit is possible to import the API specifications directly:\n\n1. Download the API specification by clicking the **Download** button at top of this document\n2. Import the JSON specification in the graphical tool of your choice.\n  - In *Postman*, you can click the **import** button at the top\n  - With *Insomnia*, you can just drag-and-drop the file on the UI\n\nNote that with *Postman*, you can also generate code snippets by selecting a request and clicking on\nthe **Code** button.\n\n## Enabling CORS\n\n[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)\nis a browser security feature that restricts HTTP requests that are\ninitiated from scripts running in the browser.\n\nFor details on enabling/configuring CORS, see\n[Enabling CORS](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/api.html).\n\n# Authentication\n\nTo be able to meet the requirements of many organizations, Airflow supports many authentication methods,\nand it is even possible to add your own method.\n\nIf you want to check which auth backend is currently set, you can use\n`airflow config get-value api auth_backends` command as in the example below.\n```bash\n$ airflow config get-value api auth_backends\nairflow.api.auth.backend.basic_auth\n```\nThe default is to deny all requests.\n\nFor details on configuring the authentication, see\n[API Authorization](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/api.html).\n\n# Errors\n\nWe follow the error response format proposed in [RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807)\nalso known as Problem Details for HTTP APIs. As with our normal API responses,\nyour client must be prepared to gracefully handle additional members of the response.\n\n## Unauthenticated\n\nThis indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication\ncredentials for the target resource. Please check that you have valid credentials.\n\n## PermissionDenied\n\nThis response means that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize\nit because it lacks sufficient rights to the resource. It happens when you do not have the\nnecessary permission to execute the action you performed. You need to get the appropriate\npermissions in other to resolve this error.\n\n## BadRequest\n\nThis response means that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something\nthat is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message\nframing, or deceptive request routing). To resolve this, please ensure that your syntax is correct.\n\n## NotFound\n\nThis client error response indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource.\n\n## MethodNotAllowed\n\nIndicates that the request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.\n\n## NotAcceptable\n\nThe target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user\nagent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the request, and the\nserver is unwilling to supply a default representation.\n\n## AlreadyExists\n\nThe request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target\nresource, e.g. the resource it tries to create already exists.\n\n## Unknown\n\nThis means that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from\nfulfilling the request.\n",

found within Apacta settings is used for authentication\n# Pagination\nIf the endpoint returns a `pagination` object it means the endpoint supports pagination - currently it's only possible to change pages with `?page={page_number}` but implementing custom page sizes are on the road map.\n\n\n# Search/filter\nIs experimental but implemented in some cases - see the individual endpoints' docs for further explanation.\n# Ordering\nIs currently experimental, but on some endpoints it's implemented on URL querys so eg. to order Invoices by `invoice_number` appending `?sort=Invoices.invoice_number&direction=desc` would sort the list descending by the value of `invoice_number`.\n# Associations\nIs currently implemented on an experimental basis where you can append eg. `?include=Contacts,Projects`  to the `/api/v1/invoices/` endpoint to embed `Contact` and `Project` objects directly.\n# Project Files\nCurrently project files can be retrieved from two endpoints. `/projects/{project_id}/files` handles files uploaded from wall posts or forms. `/projects/{project_id}/project_files` allows uploading and showing files, not belonging to specific form or wall post.\n# Errors/Exceptions\n## 422 (Validation)\nWrite something about how the `errors` object contains keys with the properties that failes validation like:\n```\n  {\n      \"success\": false,\n      \"data\": {\n          \"code\": 422,\n          \"url\": \"/api/v1/contacts?api_key=5523be3b-30ef-425d-8203-04df7caaa93a\",\n          \"message\": \"A validation error occurred\",\n          \"errorCount\": 1,\n          \"errors\": {\n              \"contact_types\": [ ## Property name that failed validation\n                  \"Contacts must have at least one contact type\" ## Message with further explanation\n              ]\n          }\n      }\n  }\n```\n## Code examples\nRunning examples of how to retrieve the 5 most recent forms registered and embed the details of the User

    "description": "Apicurio Registry is a datastore for standard event schemas and API designs. Apicurio Registry enables developers to manage and share the structure of their data using a REST interface. For example, client applications can dynamically push or pull the latest updates to or from the registry without needing to redeploy. Apicurio Registry also enables developers to create rules that govern how registry content can evolve over time. For example, this includes rules for content validation and version compatibility.\n\nThe Apicurio Registry REST API enables client applications to manage the artifacts in the registry. This API provides create, read, update, and delete operations for schema and API artifacts, rules, versions, and metadata. \n\nThe supported artifact types include:\n- Apache Avro schema\n- AsyncAPI specification\n- Google protocol buffers\n- GraphQL schema\n- JSON Schema\n- Kafka Connect schema\n- OpenAPI specification\n- Web Services Description Language\n- XML Schema Definition\n\n\n**Important**: The Apicurio Registry REST API is available from `https://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2` by default. Therefore you must prefix all API operation paths with `../apis/registry/v2` in this case. For example: `../apis/registry/v2/ids/globalIds/{globalId}`.\n",

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response.

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to the ATS API.\n\nYou can use this API to access all ATS API endpoints.\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\nWe also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete.

It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to the Connector API.\n\nYou can use this API to access all Connector API endpoints.\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\nWe also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side.

It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to the File Storage API.\n\nYou can use this API to access all File Storage API endpoints.\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\nWe also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to the HRIS API.\n\nYou can use this API to access all HRIS API endpoints.\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\nWe also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response. The response message varies, depending on the request method and the requested data.                                |\n| 201  | Created              | The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.                                                                                                              |\n| 204  | No Content           | The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.                                                                          |\n| 400  | Bad Request          | The receiving server cannot understand the request because of malformed syntax. Do not repeat the request without first modifying it; check the request for errors, fix them and then retry the request. |\n| 401  | Unauthorized         | The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.                                                                                              |\n| 402  | Payment Required     | Subscription data is incomplete or out of date. You'll need to provide payment details to continue.                                                                                                      |\n| 403  | Forbidden            | You do not have the appropriate user rights to access the request. Do not repeat the request.                                                                                                            |\n| 404  | Not Found            | The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.                                                                           |\n| 409  | Conflict             | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.                                                                                                      |\n| 422  | Unprocessable Entity | The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct but was unable to process the contained instructions.                                     |\n| 429  | Too Many Requests    | You sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limit\"). Try again later                                                                                                                     |\n| 5xx  | Server Errors        | Something went wrong with the Unify API.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute.

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It's most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency's smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response.

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                               | Type   | Required | Description |\n| ---------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Authorization                      | String | Yes      | Bearer API KEY |\n| x-apideck-app-id                   | String | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys. |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id              | String | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app.                       |\n| x-apideck-downstream-url           | String | Yes      | Downstream URL to forward the request too |\n| x-apideck-downstream-authorization | String | No       | Downstream authorization header. This will skip the Vault token injection. |\n| x-apideck-downstream-method        | String | No       | Downstream method. If not provided the upstream method will be inherited, depending on the verb/method of the request this will contain the request body you want to POST/PATCH/PUT. |\n| x-apideck-service-id               | String | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.                                   |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n### apiKey\n\nTo use API you have to sign up and get your own API key. Unify API accounts have sandbox mode and live mode API keys. To change modes just use the appropriate key to get a live or test object. You can find your API keys on the unify settings of your Apideck app. Your Apideck application_id can also be found on the same page.\n\nAuthenticate your API requests by including your test or live secret API key in the request header.\n\n- Bearer authorization header: Authorization: Bearer <your-apideck-api-key>\n- Application id header: x-apideck-app-id: <your-apideck-app-id>\n  You should use the public keys on the SDKs and the secret keys to authenticate API requests.\n\n**Do not share or include your secret API keys on client side code.** Your API keys carry significant privileges. Please ensure to keep them 100% secure and be sure to not share your secret API keys in areas that are publicly accessible like GitHub.\n\nLearn how to set the Authorization header inside Postman https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/authorization/#api-key\n\nGo to Unify to grab your API KEY https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys\n\n| Security Scheme Type      | HTTP   |\n| ------------------------- | ------ |\n| HTTP Authorization Scheme | bearer |\n\n### applicationId\n\nThe ID of your Unify application\n\n| Security Scheme Type  | API Key          |\n| --------------------- | ---------------- |\n| Header parameter name | x-apideck-app-id |\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to the Proxy API with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Timeout\n\nThe request timeout is set at 30 seconds.\n\n### Response Size\n\nThe Proxy API has no response size limit. For responses larger than 2MB, the Proxy API will redirect to a temporary URL. In this case the usual Apideck response headers will be returned in the redirect response. Most HTTP clients will handle this redirect automatically.\n\n```\nGET /proxy\n< 301 Moved Permanently\n< x-apideck-request-id: {{requestId}}\n< Location: {{temporaryUrl}}\n\nGET {{temporaryUrl}}\n< {{responseBody}}\n```\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nUpcoming. [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

    "title": "Vault API",
    "description": "Welcome to the Vault API 👋\n\nWhen you're looking to connect to an API, the first step is authentication.\n\nVault helps you handle OAuth flows, store API keys, and refresh access tokens from users (called consumers in Apideck).\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\n## Get Started\n\nTo use the Apideck APIs, you need to sign up for free at [https://app.apideck.com/signup](). Follow the steps below to get started.\n\n- [Create a free account.](https://app.apideck.com/signup)\n- Go to the [Dashboard](https://app.apideck.com/unify/unified-apis/dashboard).\n- Get your API key and the application ID.\n- Select and configure the integrations you want to make available to your users. Through the Unify dashboard, you can configure which connectors you want to support as integrations.\n- Retrieve the client_id and client_secret for the integration you want to activate (Only needed for OAuth integrations).\n- Soon, you can skip the previous step and use the Apideck sandbox credentials to get you started instead (upcoming)\n- Register the redirect URI for the example app (https://unify.apideck.com/vault/callback) in the list of redirect URIs under your app's settings\n- Use the [publishing guides](/app-listing-requirements) to get your integration listed across app marketplaces.\n\n### Hosted Vault\n\nHosted Vault (vault.apideck.com) is a no-code solution, so you don't need to build your own UI to handle the integration settings and authentication.\n\n![Hosted Vault - Integrations portal](https://github.com/apideck-samples/integration-settings/raw/master/public/img/vault.png)\n\nBehind the scenes, Hosted Vault implements the Vault API endpoints and handles the following features for your customers:\n\n- Add a connection\n- Handle the OAuth flow\n- Configure connection settings per integration\n- Manage connections\n- Discover and propose integration options\n- Search for integrations (upcoming)\n- Give integration suggestions based on provided metadata (email or website) when creating the session (upcoming)\n\nTo use Hosted Vault, you will need to first [**create a session**](https://developers.apideck.com/apis/vault/reference#operation/sessionsCreate). This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Vault API to create a valid session for a user, hereafter referred to as the consumer ID.\n\nExample using curl:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://unify.apideck.com/vault/sessions\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>\"\n    -H \"X-APIDECK-CONSUMER-ID: <consumer-id>\"\n    -H \"X-APIDECK-APP-ID: <application-id>\"\n    -d '{\"consumer_metadata\": { \"account_name\" : \"Sample\", \"user_name\": \"Sand Box\", \"email\": \"sand@box.com\", \"image\": \"https://unavatar.now.sh/jake\" }, \"theme\": { \"vault_name\": \"Intercom\", \"primary_color\": \"#286efa\", \"sidepanel_background_color\": \"#286efa\",\"sidepanel_text_color\": \"#FFFFFF\", \"favicon\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/apideck/icons/intercom\" }}'\n```\n\n### Vault API\n\n_Beware, this is strategy takes more time to implement in comparison to Hosted Vault._\n\nIf you are building your integration settings UI manually, you can call the Vault API directly.\n\nThe Vault API is for those who want to completely white label the in-app integrations overview and authentication experience. All the available endpoints are listed below.\n\nThrough the API, your customers authenticate directly in your app, where Vault will still take care of redirecting to the auth provider and back to your app.\n\nIf you're already storing access tokens, we will help you migrate through our Vault Migration API (upcoming).\n\n## Domain model\n\nAt its core, a domain model creates a web of interconnected entities.\n\nOur domain model contains five main entity types: Consumer (user, account, team, machine), Application, Connector, Integration, and Connection.\n\n## Connection state\n\nThe connection state is computed based on the connection flow below.\n\n![](https://developers.apideck.com/api-references/vault/connection-flow.png)\n\n## Unify and Proxy integration\n\nThe only thing you need to use the Unify APIs and Proxy is the consumer id; thereafter, Vault will do the look-up in the background to handle the token injection before performing the API call(s).\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/api-keys. |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes. |\n\n## Sandbox (upcoming)\n\nThe sandbox is pre-loaded with data similar to a real-life integrations setup. You can use the preconfigured OAauth configured connectors for testing purposes and can skip this step by using the Apideck sandbox credentials to get you started.\n\n## Guides\n\n- [How to build an integrations UI with Vault](https://github.com/apideck-samples/integration-settings)\n- How to configure the OAuth credentials for integration providers (COMING SOON)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**What purpose does Vault serve? Can I just handle the authentication and access token myself?**\nYou can store everything yourself, but that defeats the purpose of using Apideck Unify. Handling tokens for multiple providers can quickly become very complex.\n\n### Is my data secure?\n\nVault employs data minimization, therefore only requesting the minimum amount of scopes needed to perform an API request.\n\n### How do I migrate existing data?\n\nUsing our migration API, you can migrate the access tokens and accounts to Apideck Vault. (COMING SOON)\n\n### Can I use Vault in combination with existing integrations?\n\nYes, you can. The flexibility of Unify allows you to quickly the use cases you need while keeping a gradual migration path based on your timeline and requirements.\n\n### How does Vault work for Apideck Ecosystem customers?\n\nOnce logged in, pick your ecosystem; on the left-hand side of the screen, you'll have the option to create an application underneath the Unify section.\n\n### How to integrate Apideck Vault\n\nThis section covers everything you need to know to authenticate your customers through Vault.\nVault provides **three auth strategies** to use API tokens from your customers:\n\n- Vault API\n- Hosted Vault\n- Apideck Ecosystem _(COMING SOON)_\n\nYou can also opt to bypass Vault and still take care of authentication flows yourself. Make sure to put the right safeguards in place to protect your customers' tokens and other sensitive data.\n\n### What auth types does Vault support?\n\nWhat auth strategies does Vault handle? We currently support three flows so your customers can activate an integration.\n\n#### API keys\n\nFor Services supporting the API key strategy, you can use Hosted Vault will need to provide an in-app form where users can configure their API keys provided by the integration service.\n\n#### OAuth 2.0\n\n##### Authorization Code Grant Type Flow\n\nVault handles the complete Authorization Code Grant Type Flow for you. This flow only supports browser-based (passive) authentication because most identity providers don't allow entering a username and password to be entered into applications that they don't own.\n\nCertain connectors require an OAuth redirect authentication flow, where the end-user is redirected to the provider's website or mobile app to authenticate.\n\nThis is being handled by the `/authorize` endpoint.\n\n#### Basic auth\n\nBasic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The required fields to complete basic auth are handled by Hosted Vault or by updating the connection through the Vault API below.\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to the Webhook API.\n\nYou can use this API to access all Webhook API endpoints.\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\nWe also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

Defaults, examples, and\npossible values are additionally rendered in double quotes for readability. In practice, query parameters should\nnot have quotes around the values (e.g., `foo=bar` is valid, not `foo=\"bar\"`), and both query parameter keys\nand values must be percent-encoded, per the requirements in [RFC 3986 § 3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4).\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nIn order to provide a fair distribution of available resources, all API calls are subject to rate limits.\nIf you exceed the number of API calls per minute granted to your credential, a `429 Too Many Requests`\nerror response will be returned.\n\nIn that case, a `Retry-After` header MAY be included in the response, describing the number of seconds\nafter which a request can be retried.\n\nIf you run into a high number of 429 errors, please reach out to ART19 Support to adjust your rate limit.\n\n### Example\n\nIn the following example the request can be retried after waiting for 21 seconds:\n\n    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\n    Content-Type: text/html\n    Retry-After: 21\n\n## Pagination\n\nRequests to collection endpoints **SHOULD** provide pagination parameters.\nSome endpoints **REQUIRE** pagination parameters to be provided.\nWhenever pagination is provided, it **MUST** be valid.\nFailing to provide pagination when it is required or providing wrong or incomplete pagination\nalways results in a `400 Bad Request` error response.\n\nThe page numbering starts with `1` and the maximum page size (if not otherwise documented\non an endpoint) is `100`. Pagination **MUST NOT** be specified if requesting a list of IDs (using an `ids[]` parameter).\n\nProviding invalid values for page number or page size, as well as providing only a page number or only a page size,\nis considered an error. Pagination is provided like this:\n\n`page[number]=1&page[size]=25`\n\nResponses conform to the [JSON:API specification's pagination section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination)\nby including pagination links. Your requested page size will be carried into the pagination links.\n\n## Sorting\n\nRequests to collection endpoints usually accept a `sort` parameter. Please refer to the\n[JSON:API Specification's sorting section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting) for further details.\n\n## Relationship Linking\n\nCurrently, resources return all of their relationships, in no particular order, pursuant to how relationships\nshould be returned [according to the JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships). Consumers of this API\n**MUST NOT** make assumptions about the order of these collections. Even though this data is not currently paginated, consumers **MUST** support\npaginating relationships per the JSON:API specification if this data is important for their application.\n",

    "description": "# Introduction\nThe SearchLy API provides similarity searching based on song lyrics.\n\n# Operations\nThe API allows for the `/similarity/by_song` operation, which allows clients to search the similarity for an existing song in the database. Also, the API has an additional `/similarity/by_content` endpoint which allows clients to search similarity given a free String input through a JSON request body. Additional `/song/search` operation is available for searching songs given a query String.\n\n# Endpoint\nThe API endpoint for the SearchLy API v1 is as follows:\n```\nhttps://searchly.asuarez.dev/api/v1\n```\n\n# Motivation\nThis project was built in order to create an API for searching similarities based on song lyrics. There are a lot of songs in the industry and most of them are talking about the same topic. What I wanted to prove with SearchLy was to estimate how similar are two songs between them based on the meaning of their lyrics.\n\nSearchLy is using a database of 100k songs from AZLyrics, using [this scraper](https://github.com/AlbertSuarez/azlyrics-scraper), which is being updated periodically. Then, using word2vec and NMSLIB, it was possible to create an index where you can search similarities using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.\n\n> **Note**: I am currently using a micro-instance from DigitalOcean where the API is deployed, so you should expect a bad performance. However, if this API becomes popular I will deploy it in a bigger instance.\n",

    "id": "ato.gov.au",
    "title": "Business Registries",
    "description": "# Introduction\nThe Business Registries API is built on HTTP. The API is RESTful. It has predictable resource URIs.\n\n  The API is documented in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification\">OpenAPI</a> format.\n  In addition to the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few\n  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md\">vendor extensions</a>.\n\n# Overview\nThe following sections describe the resources that make up the Business Registries REST API.\n## Current Version\nBy default, all requests to https://api.abr.ato.gov.au receive the `v1` version of the REST API. We encourage you to explicitly request this version via the `Accept` header.\n\n    Accept: application/vnd.abr-ato.v1+json\n\n## Schema\nAll API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from https://api.abr.ato.gov.au. All data is sent and received as JSON. Blank fields are included.\n\n  All dates use the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:\n\n    YYYY-MM-DD\n\n  For example: `2017-07-01` (the 1st of July 2017)\n\n  All timestamps use the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:\n\n    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\n\n  For example: `2017-07-01T11:05:06+10:00`\n\n## Timezones\nSome requests allow for specifying timestamps or generate timestamps with time zone information. We apply the following rules, in order of priority, to determine timezone information for API calls.\n### Explicitly provide an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information\nFor API calls that allow for a timestamp to be specified, we use that exact timestamp.\n\n  For example: `2017-07-01T11:05:06+10:00`\n\n## Pagination\nInformation about pagination is provided in the [Link](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6) header.\n\n  For example:\n\n    Link: <https://api.abr.ato.gov.au/individuals?page=2>; rel=\"next\",\n          <https://api.abr.ato.gov.au/individuals?page=34>; rel=\"last\"\n\n`rel=\"next\"` states that the next page is `page=2`. This makes sense, since by default, all paginated queries start at page `1`. `rel=\"last\"` provides some more information, stating that the last page of results is on `page 34`. Accordingly, we have 33 more pages of information that we can consume.\n## Parameters\nMany API methods take optional parameters:\n\n    GET /individuals/1234/addresses/?addressType='Mailing'\n\nIn this example, the '1234' value is provided for the `:partyId` parameter in the path while `:addressType` is passed in the query string.\nFor POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded as JSON with a Content-Type of 'application/json'.\n## Metadata\nThe API provides **metadata services** that you can use to discover information about the classifcation schemes and values used by the Registry.\n\n  For example:\n\n    GET /classifications/roles\n\n  Sample response:\n\n    [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440001\",\n        \"role\": \"Director\",\n        \"roleDescription\": \"An individual responsible for managing a company's ...\",\n        \"relationship\": \"Directorship\",\n        \"reciprocalRole\": \"Company\",\n        \"reciprocalRoleDescription\": \"An incorporated legal entity.\"\n      },\n      {\n        ...\n      }\n    ]\n\n## Root Endpoint\nYou can issue a GET request to the root endpoint (also known as the service root) to get all the endpoint categories that the REST API supports:\n\n    curl https://api.abr.ato.gov.au\n\n## Authentication\nThe Business Registries API supports API Key authentication.\n\n  When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key. You can generate additional API keys, and delete\n  API keys (as you may need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the Business Registries API by\n  providing your secret key in the request header.\n\n  **Note:** Some requests will return `404 Not Found`, instead of `403 Permission Denied`. This is to prevent the\n  accidental leakage of information to unauthorised users.\n",

Entire Detect is for detecting the whole series with model trained by the time series, Last Detect is detecting last point with model trained by points before. ChangePoint Detect is for detecting trend changes in time series. In stateful mode, user can store time series, the stored time series will be used for detection anomalies. Under this mode, user can still use the above three functionalities by only giving a time range without preparing time series in client side. Besides the above three functionalities, stateful model also provide group based detection and labeling service. By leveraging labeling service user can provide labels for each detection result, these labels will be used for retuning or regenerating detection models. Inconsistency detection is a kind of group based detection, this detection will find inconsistency ones in a set of time series. By using anomaly detector service, business customers can discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root cause analysis.",

The service manages one or more workers that are joined to a customer's virtual network, which is assumed to provide connectivity to their databases. To avoid frequent updates to the resource provider, data migration tasks are implemented by the resource provider in a generic way as task resources, each of which has a task type (which identifies the type of work to run), input, and output. The client is responsible for providing appropriate task type and inputs, which will be passed through unexamined to the machines that implement the functionality, and for understanding the output, which is passed back unexamined to the client.",

    "description": "The SEDRA API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and uses [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) for documentation.\n# Introduction\nThis document describes the JSON API for the Syriac Electronic Data Research Archive (SEDRA). The SEDRA project is a linguistic and literary database of Syriac language and literature focusing on providing electronic access to the corpus of Syriac lexicons with linguistic information added to each entry in those lexicons. The API is a mechanism to provide the linguistic information stored in SEDRA to a broader audience.\nAdditionally there is a XML API for Syriac words which conforms to a prototype Semitic Languages schema which can be found in the XSD file https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/semiticLanguages.xsd.\n# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\nThis API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) and allows cross-domain communication from the browser.\nAll responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.\n# Samples\nExplaining how to lookup words in the SEDRA API is complex and would clutter the API description. For that reason we have chosen to give the explanation of how to lookup words in its own section. SEDRA can lookup words by the SEDRA word Id. However, it will often be the case that the consumer of information provided by the SEDRA API does not know the SEDRA word Id. It is for that reason that the SEDRA API provides a method to lookup words by the Syriac text. But that process is complicated by the nature of Syriac writing. So the SEDRA API will lookup words for consonantal, partially vocalized, and fully vocalized Syriac text. Using the word Id will provide the most accurate results as the exact word will be returned. Fully vocalized text will provide the next most accurate result. The least accurate results will be returned by partially vocalized and consonantal Syriac words in that order. Following are some samples to help understand how this works.\n1. By Word Id [30862](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/30862.json)\n2. By fully vocalized Syriac word [ܐܰܒܳܪܳܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐܰܒܳܪܳܐ.json)\n3. By partially vocalized Syriac word [ܐܶܒܪܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐܶܒܪܐ.json)\n4. By consonantal Syriac word [ܐܒܪܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐܒܪܐ.json).",

    "description": "# Budgea Development Guides\n\nWelcome to **Budgea**'s documentation.\n\nThis documentation is intended to get you up-and-running with our APIs and advise on the implementation of some regulatory aspects of your application, following the DSP2's guidelines.\n\n## Getting Started\n**IMPORTANT**\nDepending on your status with regard of the DSP2 regulation, **agent** or **partner**, you may call our APIs or simply use our Webview and callbacks to get the financial data of your users.\nAs an **agent**, you are allowed to call directly our APIs and implement your own form to get the user's credentials.\nAs a **partner**, you cannot manipulate the credentials, and have to delegate this step to us through our webview.\n\nThe sections below will document how to use our APIs, make sure you have the **agent** status to do so.\nFor the **partner**, please refer to the section *Webview* and *Callbacks* of this documentation.\n\n### Overview\nYour API is a REST API which requires a communication through https to send and receive JSON documents.\nDuring your tests, we recommend to make calls to the API with curl or any other HTTP client of your choice.\nYou can watch a video demonstration on this [URL](https://asciinema.org/a/FsaFyt3WAPyDm7sfaZPkwal3V).\nFor the examples we'll use the demo API with address `https://demo.biapi.pro`, you should change that name to your API's name.\n\n### Hello World\nLet's start by calling the service `/banks` which lists all available banks.\n```\ncurl https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0/banks/\n```\nTo log in to a bank webpage, you'll need to know for a given bank, the fields your user should fill in the form.\nLet's call a  specific bank and ask for an additional resource *fields*.\n```\ncurl https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0/banks/59?expand=fields\n```\nThe response here concerns only 1 bank (since we specified an id) and the resource _Fields_ is added to the response thanks to the query parameter `expand`.\n\nTo get more interesting things done, you'll need to send authenticated requests.\n\n### Authentication\nThe way to authenticate is by passing the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in your request.\nAt the setup a _manage token_ have been generated, you can use this token for now, when creating your user we'll see how to generate a user's token.\n```\ncurl https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0/config \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\n```\nThis endpoint will list all the parameters you can change to adapt Budgea to your needs.\n\nWe've covered the very first calls. Before diving deeper, let's see some general information about the APIs.\n\n## Abstract\n\n### API URL\n`https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0`\n\n### Requests format\nData format: **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** or **application/json** (suggested)\n\nAdditional headers: Authorization: User's token (private)\n\n### Responses format\nData format: **application/json** ([http://www.json.org](http://www.json.org/))\nCharset: **UTF-8**\n\n### Resources\nEach call on an endpoint will return resources. The main resources are:\n| Resource            | Description                                                                                                           |\n| ---------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   |\n|Users                 |Represent a user                                                                                                      |\n|Connection            |A set of data used to authenticate on a website (usually a login and password).

API\n\nThis API is RESTful, which means it is stateless and each resource is accessed with an unique URI.\n\nSeveral HTTP methods are available:\n\n| Method                  | Description                    |\n| ------------------------|:-------------------------------|\n| GET /resources          | List resources                 |\n| GET /resources/{ID}     | Get a resource from its ID     |\n|

/resources       | Remove every resources         |\n| DELETE /resources/{ID}  | Delete a resource              |\n\n\nEach resource can contain sub-resources, for example:\n`/users/me/connections/2/accounts/23/transactions/48`\n\n### HTTP response codes\n\n| Code        | Message               | Description

Now let's see how to integrate Budgea in your app and create your first user.\n\n## Integrate Budgea *(protocol or Webview)*\n### The workflow\nUsers of your application exist in the Budgea API.\nEvery User is identified by an access_token which is the shared secret between your application and our API.\n\nThe workflow is as below:\n1. The user is on your application and wants to share his bank accounts or invoices.\n2. A call is made **client side** (browser's javascript or desktop application) to create a temporarily token which will be used to make API calls.\n3. A form is built, allowing the user to select the connector to use (bank or provider, depending on context). Every connector requires different kind of credentials.\n4. A call on the API is made with the temporarily token to add a **Connection** with the credentials supplied by user.\n5. In case of success, the user chooses what bank accounts (**Account**) or subscriptions (**Subscription**) he wants to share with your application.\n6. When he validates the share, the temporarily token is transmitted to your server. This one will call the Budgea API with this token to get a permanent token.\n\n**Note**\nIn case your application works without a server (for example a desktop application), the permanent token can be obtained on the 1st step, by supplying a client_secret to /auth/init and the step 6 is omitted. To get more information, read the protocol.\n\nThere are 3 steps to integrate Budgea in your application:\n1. Provide a way for your users to share their credentials with you\n2. Get the data scraped from Budgea\n3. Be sure to follow the good practices before going into production\n\n### Get credentials from users\nYou have 2 options here:\n- Integrate the Budget Insight's Webview, a turnkey solution to get user's credentials\n- Create your own form following the protocol (must have the *agent* status)\n\n### Budgea webview\n\nThe Budgea webview complements REST API endpoints with web-based services to handle sensitive or complex operations:\n- add a connection (to a bank or a provider), or edit/repare access to a connection;\n- manage connections (add/remove/edit);\n- edit and validate bank transfers (alpha preview).\n\nUsage of the webview is mandatory if you don't hold an Agent status, since you are not allowed to use API endpoints carrying user credentials, and optional otherwise.\n\n#### Implementation guidelines\n\n##### Base URL\n\nThe base URL of all services must be customized:  \n`https://{{domain}}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/`  \n`https://{{domain}}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/{{lang}}/`  \n- `{{domain}}`: substitute with you API domain;\n- `{{lang}}`: optionally specify the language of the webview, `en` or `fr` (if not specified, an automatic redirection will be performed following the language of the browser).\n\n##### Browser integration\n\nServices available as part of the webview are designed as parameterized URLs intended to be opened in a web browser. A callback URI must be specified by callers to be notified at the end of the operation flow, similar to OAuth 2 specification.\n\nYou are encouraged to integrate web-based steps in your product following UX best practices:\n- in a web environment, perform a full-page redirect to the URL (using either [HTTP redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302) or [scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Location)), and avoid new tabs or popups;\n- in a native Android app, prefer opening the default browser or relying on [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs) to integrating a WebView;\n- in a native iOS app, prefer using a [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) to integrating a WKWebView.\n\n##### Callback handling\n\nMost flows redirect to a callback URI at the end of the process. Query parameters are added to the URI to identify successful or failed operations.\n\nSuccessful parameters are specific to each flow. In case of an error, the following parameters are added:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| - | - |\n| `error` | An lowercase string error code identifying the kind of error that occurred. When the parameter is not present, the response is successful. |\n| `error_description` | A longer string description of the error (not intended for user display). |\n\nCommon error codes include:\n\n| Code | Description |\n| - | - |\n| `access_denied` | The user explicitly cancelled the flow. |\n| `server_error` | Oops, a technical failure occurred during the process. |\n\n**Forward compatibility requirement**: Additional error codes may be added in the future to describe specific cases. When implementing error codes handling, always fallback to a generic case for unknown codes.\n\n##### Browser compatibility\n\nThe webview is designed and tested to work with browsers supported by the Angular framework:  \nhttps://angular.io/guide/browser-support\n\n##### Privacy / GDPR status\n\nThe webview itself does not use any kind of long-term data persistence mechanism such as cookies or local storage, but some authentication or authorization steps may delegate to third-party web services that may implement them.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nYou can configure the appearance and behaviour of the webview by configuring the associated *Client Application* in the console:\n\n| Key | Format | Description |\n| - | - | - |\n| `primary_color` | String | Optional. An accent color (hexadecimal string without '#' prefix) to personalize the UI elements of the webview. If absent, the default color is grey. |\n| `redirect_uri` | String | Optional. A recommended security whitelist configuration. The `redirect_uri` parameter sent to any endpoint of the webview is checked against the configuration, if any. |\n| `config.disable_connector_hints` | Boolean | Optional. This flags hides the list of most-used entries in the connector selection step. The default is `false`, i.e. the list is shown. |\n| `config.use_app_layout` | Boolean | Optional. Use this flag to enable presenting your log as an app icon. The default value is ` false`, i.e. the logo is shown in the top bar of the UI. |\n| `config.disable_accounts_pre_check` | Boolean | Optional. An optional boolean flag to prevent bank accounts to be automatically pre-checked when the user enters the activation step. The default value is ` false`, i.e. the bank accounts are pre-checked. |\n\n#### Endpoints reference\n\n##### Add connection flow\n```\nhttps://{{domain}}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/{{lang}}/connect\n```\n\nThis flow allows an end-user to add a new connection to the API. The flow handles the following steps:\n- selecting a connector;\n- authenticating & authorizing with the connector, by collecting credentials or delegating;\n- managing consent to aggregate accounts/subscriptions;\n- collecting required information for professional accounts.\n\n###### Endpoint parameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| - | - |\n| `client_id` | Required.

Identical to the `state` parameter that was initially specified. |\n\n###### Additional error codes\n\n| Code | Description |\n| - | - |\n| `tos_declined` | The end-user refused to validate the terms of service. |\n\n#### Migrating from v3\n\nWe provide a full backward compatibility layer with current implementations of the webview v3 to ease the transition. All endpoints remains accessible, with the same parameters and callback behaviour. Migration instructions are provided below.\n\n*The v3 compatibility mode is expected to be removed on 31 December 2019.* You should migrate your implementation a soon as possible to new endpoints and parameters.\n\n##### Add connection flow / Edit connection credentials  \n```\n/connect/select\n```\n\nThis endpoint has been superseded by `/connect` (no suffix) for adding a new connection, and `/reconnect` for resetting or updating an existing connection.\n\n| Endpoint parameter | Migration instructions |\n| - | - |\n| `client_id` | No change. |\n| `redirect_uri`, `state` | No change. |\n| `response_type` | This parameter is not used anymore. |\n| `id_connector`, `connectors` | Superseded by `connector_ids` sent to the `/connect` endpoint. |\n| `types` | Superseded by `connector_capabilities` sent to the `/connect` endpoint.<br>Use`connector_capabilities=bank` (bank connection) or `connector_capabilities=document` (provider connection). |\n| `id_connection` | Superseded by `connection_id` sent to the `/reconnect` endpoint. |\n\nPassing the code or access token as an URL fragment is no longer supported, use the `code` query parameter.\n\n| Callback parameter | Migration instructions |\n| - | - |\n| `id_connection` | Superseded by `connection_id`.<br>In the `/reconnect` flow, this parameter is not returned anymore. |\n| `code` | Still named `code`, but in the `/connect` flow the parameter is now **only** added if an anonymous user was created, i.e. the `code` parameter was **not** provided as a query parameter or fragment.<br>In the `/reconnect` flow, this parameter is not returned anymore. |\n| `state` | No change. |\n\n##### Manage connections\n\n```\n/accounts\n```\n\nThis endpoint has been superseded by `/manage`, that now fully allows users to add/remove connections, reset their credentials or recover from error states.\n\n| Endpoint parameter | Migration instructions |\n| - | - |\n| `client_id` | No change. |\n| `redirect_uri`, `state` | No change, these parameters are now optional. |\n| `response_type` | This parameter is not used anymore. |\n| `types` | Superseded by `connector_capabilities`.<br>Use`connector_capabilities=bank` (bank connection) or `connector_capabilities=document` (provider connection). |\n\nPassing the code or access token as an URL fragment is no longer supported, use the `code` query parameter.\n\n| Callback parameter | Migration instructions |\n| - | - |\n| `code` | This parameter is not returned anymore. |\n| `state` | No change. |\n\n##### Behaviour change\n\nIn v3, the `/accounts` flow used to redirect to the `redirect_uri` after a connection addition. This is no longer the case in v4, where redirection is only performed when the user explicitly closes the flow. If you need to perform actions when a connection is added or removed, you should rely on webhooks.\n\n#### Protocol\nThis section describes the protocol used to set bank and provider accounts of a user, in case you don't want to use the webview.\n\nThe idea is to call the following services client-side (with AJAX in case of a web application), to ensure the bank and providers credentials will not be sent to your servers.\n\n1. /auth/init\n```http\nPOST /auth/init\n```\n```json\n{\n   \"auth_token\" : \"fBqjMZbYddebUGlkR445JKPA6pCoRaGb\",\n   \"type\" : \"temporary\",\n   \"expires_in\" : 1800,\n   \"id_user\": 1\n}\n```\nThis service creates a temporarily token, to use in the \"Authorization\" header in next calls to the API\n\nThe returned token has a life-time of 30 minutes, and should be transfered to the API then (cf Permanent Token), so that your server can get a permanent access_token.\n\nIt is possible to generate a permanent token immediately, by calling the service with the manage_token, or by supply parameters client_id and client_secret.\n\n2. /banks or /providers\n```http\nGET /banks?expand=fields\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n```\n```json\n{\n   \"hidden\" : false,\n         \"charged\" : true,\n         \"name\" : \"American Express\",\n         \"id\" : 30,\n         \"fields\" : [\n            {\n               \"values\" : [\n                  {\n                     \"label\" : \"Particuliers/Professionnels\",\n                     \"value\" : \"pp\"\n                  },\n                  {\n                     \"value\" : \"ent\",\n                     \"label\" : \"Entreprises\"\n                  }\n               ],\n               \"label\" : \"Type de compte\",\n               \"regex\" : null,\n               \"name\" : \"website\",\n               \"type\" : \"list\"\n            },\n            {\n               \"type\" : \"password\",\n               \"label\" : \"Code secret\",\n               \"name\" : \"password\",\n               \"regex\" : \"^[0-9]{6}$\"\n            }\n         ],\n      },\n      ...\n   ],\n   \"total\" : 44,\n}\n```\nYou get a list of connectors, and all associated fields needed to build the form at step 3.\nYou can also use that list to show to your user, all available banks.\n\n3. /users/me/connections\nMake a POST request and supply the id_bank (ID of the chosen bank) or id_provider (ID of provider), and all requested fields as key/value parameters.\nFor example:\n```http\nPOST /users/me/connections\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n-F login=12345678\n-F password=123456\n-F id_bank=59\n```\nYou can get the following return codes:\n\n|Code           |Description                                                  |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------ |\n|200            |The connection has succeed and has been created              |\n|202            |It is necessary to provide complementary information. This occurs on the first connection on some kind of Boursorama accounts for example, where a SMS is sent to the customer. It is necessary to ask the user to fill fields requested in the fields, and do a POST again on /users/me/connections/ID, with the connection ID in id_connection. |\n|400            |Unable to connect to the website, the field error in the JSON can be **websiteUnavailable** or **wrongpass**  |\n|403            |Invalid token                                                |\n\n4. Activate accounts\nThe accounts the user wants to aggregate must be activated before any transaction or investment is retrieved.\nSeveral accounts can be activated in 1 request by separating the account ids with commas.\n```http\nPUT /users/me/connections/<id_connection>/accounts/<id_account>?all\n```\n\n5. Permanent token\nIf the user validates the share of his accounts, it is necessary to transform the temporary code to a permanent access_token (so that the user won't expire).\n\nTo do that, make a POST request on /auth/token/access with the following parameters:\n|Parameter            |Description                                                     |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|code                 |The temporarily token which will let you get the access_token   |\n|client_id            |The ID of your client application                               |\n|client_secret        |The secret of your client application                           |\n\n```json\nPOST /auth/token/access\n\n{\n   \"client_id\" : 17473055,\n   \"client_secret\" : \"54tHJHjvodbANVzaRtcLzlHGXQiOgw80\",\n   \"code\" : \"fBqjMZbYddebUGlkR445JKPA6pCoRaGb\"\n}\n```\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n{\n   \"access_token\" : \"7wBPuFfb1Hod82f1+KNa0AmrkIuQ3h1G\",\n   \"token_type\":\"Bearer\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update accounts\nAnother important call is when a user wants to add/remove connections to banks or providers, or to change the password on one of them, it is advised to give him a temporarily code from the permanent access_token, with the following call (using the access_token as bearer):\n```http\nPOST /auth/token/code\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n```\n```json\n{\n   \"code\" : \"/JiDppWgbmc+5ztHIUJtHl0ynYfw682Z\",\n   \"type\" : \"temporary\",\n   \"expires_in\" : 1800,\n}\n```\nIts life-time is 30 minutes, and let the browser to list connections and accounts, via `GET /users/me/connections?expand=accounts` for example.\n\n To update the password of a connection, you can do a POST on the *connection* resource, with the field *password* in the data. The new credentials are checked to make sure they are valid, and the return codes are the same as when adding a connection.\n\n## Getting the data (Webhooks)\nYou have created your users and their connections, now it's time to get the data.\nThere are 2 ways to retrieve it, the 2 can be complementary:\n- make regular calls to the API\n- use the webhooks (recommended)\n\n### Manual Synchronization\nIt is possible to do a manual synchronization of a user. We recommend to use this method in case the user wants fresh data after logging in.\n\nTo trigger the synchronization, call the API as below:\n`PUT /users/ID/connections`\nThe following call is blocking until the synchronization is terminated.\n\nEven if it is not recommended, it's possible to fetch synchronously new data. To do that, you can use the *expand* parameter:\n` /users/ID/connections?expand=accounts[transactions,investments[type]],subscriptions`\n```json\n{\n   \"connections\" : [\n      {\n         \"accounts\" : [\n            {\n               \"balance\" : 7481.01,\n               \"currency\" : {\n                  \"symbol\" : \"€\",\n                  \"id\" : \"EUR\",\n                  \"prefix\" : false\n               },\n               \"deleted\" : null,\n               \"display\" : true,\n               \"formatted_balance\" : \"7 481,01 €\",\n               \"iban\" : \"FR76131048379405300290000016\",\n               \"id\" : 17,\n               \"id_connection\" : 7,\n               \"investments\" : [\n                  {\n                     \"code\" : \"FR0010330902\",\n                     \"description\" : \"\",\n                     \"diff\" : -67.86,\n                     \"id\" : 55,\n                     \"id_account\" : 19,\n                     \"id_type\" : 1,\n                     \"label\" : \"Agressor PEA\",\n                     \"portfolio_share\" : 0.48,\n                     \"prev_diff\" : 2019.57,\n                     \"quantity\" : 7.338,\n                     \"type\" : {\n                        \"color\" : \"AABBCC\",\n                        \"id\" : 1,\n                        \"name\" : \"Fonds action\"\n                     },\n                     \"unitprice\" : 488.98,\n                     \"unitvalue\" : 479.73,\n                     \"valuation\" : 3520.28\n                  }\n               ],\n               \"last_update\" : \"2015-07-04 15:17:30\",\n               \"name\" : \"Compte chèque\",\n               \"number\" : \"3002900000\",\n               \"transactions\" : [\n                  {\n                     \"active\" : true,\n                     \"application_date\" : \"2015-06-17\",\n                     \"coming\" : false,\n                     \"comment\" : null,\n                     \"commission\" : null,\n                     \"country\" : null,\n                     \"date\" : \"2015-06-18\",\n                     \"date_scraped\" : \"2015-07-04 15:17:30\",\n                     \"deleted\" : null,\n                     \"documents_count\" : 0,\n                     \"formatted_value\" : \"-16,22 €\",\n                     \"id\" : 309,\n                     \"id_account\" : 17,\n                     \"id_category\" : 9998,\n                     \"id_cluster\" : null,\n                     \"last_update\" : \"2015-07-04 15:17:30\",\n                     \"new\" : true,\n                     \"original_currency\" : null,\n                     \"original_value\" : null,\n                     \"original_wording\" : \"FACTURE CB HALL'S BEER\",\n                     \"rdate\" : \"2015-06-17\",\n                     \"simplified_wording\" : \"HALL'S BEER\",\n                     \"state\" : \"parsed\",\n                     \"stemmed_wording\" : \"HALL'S BEER\",\n                     \"type\" : \"card\",\n                     \"value\" : -16.22,\n                     \"wording\" : \"HALL'S BEER\"\n                  }\n               ],\n               \"type\" : \"checking\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"error\" : null,\n         \"expire\" : null,\n         \"id\" : 7,\n         \"id_user\" : 7,\n         \"id_bank\" : 41,\n         \"last_update\" : \"2015-07-04 15:17:31\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"total\" : 1,\n}\n```\n\n### Background synchronizations & Webhooks\nWebhooks are callbacks sent to your server, when an event is triggered during a synchronization.\nSynchronizations are automatic, the frequency can be set using the configuration key `autosync.frequency`.\nUsing webhooks allows you to get the most up-to-date data of your users, after each synchronization.\n\nThe automatic synchronization makes it possible to recover new bank entries, or new invoices, at a given frequency.\nYou have the possibility to add webhooks on several events, and choose to receive each one on a distinct URL.\nTo see the list of available webhooks you can call the endpoint hereunder:\n```\ncurl https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0/webhooks_events \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\n```\n\nThe background synchronizations for each user are independent, and their plannings are spread over the day so that they do not overload any website.\n\nOnce the synchronization of a user is over, a POST request is sent on the callback URL you have defined, including all webhook data.\nA typical json sent to your server is as below:\n```http\nPOST /callback HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nContent-Length: 959\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: Budgea API/2.0\nContent-Type: application/json;

If this is not the case, you can contact us to add your CA (Certificate Authority) to our PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).\n\nImportant: it is necessary to send back a HTTP 200 code, without what we consider that data is not correctly taken into account on your system, and it will be sent again at the next user synchronization.\n\n## Guidelines for production\nNow you should have integrated the API inside your application. Make sure your Webhooks URLs are in HTTPS, if so you can enable the production state of the API.\n\nTo make things great, here are some good practices, please check you have respected them:\n- You have provided to your users a way to configure their accounts\n- You have provided to your users a way to change their account passwords\n- You consider the **error** field of Connections, to alert the user in case the state is **wrongpass**\n- You map IDs of Accounts, Subscriptions, Transactions and Documents in your application, to be sure to correctly match them\n- When the deleted field is set on a bank transaction, you delete it in your database\n- You don't loop on all users to launch synchronizations, this might saturate the service\n\nIf you have questions about above points, please contact us. Otherwise, you can put into production!\n\n### Going further\nIf you want to raise the bar for your app and add features such as the ability to do transfers, get invoices, aggregate patrimony and more, please refer to the sections below.\nWe'll discuss complementary APIs building upon the aggregation, allowing for the best of financial apps.\n\n## Budgea API Pay\nThis API allows for the emition of transfers between the aggregated accounts.\nJust like the simple aggregation, BI provides a webview or a protocol to follow, to implement this feature.\n\n### API pay protocol\nThis section describes how the transfer and recipient protocol work, in case you don't want to integrate the webview.\nThe idea is to do following calls client side (with AJAX in case of a web application), so that the interaction with the Budgea API is transparent.\n\n#### Executing a transfer\n1. /auth/token/code\nIf you do calls client side, get a new temporary code for the user, from the access_token.

    "description": "#Documentation\r\n\r\nThis is the documentation for the partner endpoint of the BigOven Recipe and Grocery List API.\r\n\r\nThe update brings with it Swagger-based documentation. [Swagger](http://swagger.io) is an emerging standard for describing REST-based APIs, and with this Swagger-compliant endpoint (above), you can make ready-to-go interface libraries for your code via [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). For instance, it's easy to generate libraries for Node.js, Java, Ruby, ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, php and more!\r\n\r\nYou can also try out the endpoint calls with your own api_key right here on this page. Be sure to enter your api_key above to use the \"Try it out!\" buttons on this page.\r\n\r\n##Start Here\r\n\r\nDevelopers new to the BigOven API should start with this version, not with the legacy API. We'll be making improvements to this API over time, and doing only bug fixes on the v1 API.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pretend you're a BigOven user (for instance, to get your recently viewed recipes or your grocery list), you need to pass in Basic Authentication information in the header, just as with the v1 API. We do now require that you make all calls via https. You need to pass your api_key in with every call, though this can now be done on the header (send a request header \"X-BigOven-API-Key\" set to your api_key value, e.g., Request[\"X-BigOven-API-Key\"]=\"your-key-here\".)\r\n\r\n##Migration Notes\r\n\r\nFor existing partners, we encourage you to [migrate](https://api2.bigoven.com), and while at this writing we have no hard-and-fast termination date for the v1 API, we strongly prefer that you migrate by January 1, 2017. While the changes aren't overly complex, there are several breaking changes, including refactoring of recipe search and results and removal of support for XML. This is not a simply plug-and-play replacement to the v1 API. With respect to an exclusive focus on JSON, the world has spoken, and it prefers JSON for REST-based API's. We've taken numerous steps to refactor the API to make it more REST-compliant. Note that this v2 API will be the preferred API from this point onward, so we encourage developers to migrate to this new format. We have put together some [migration notes](/web/documentation/migration-to-v2) that we encourage you to read carefully.\r\n\r\n##Photos\r\n\r\nSee our [photos documentation](https://api2.bigoven.com/web/documentation/recipe-images). \r\n\r\nFor more information on usage of this API, including features, pricing, rate limits, terms and conditions, please visit the [BigOven API website](https://api2.bigoven.com).",

    "description": "Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual machine.\n\n This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints are summarized under the following tags: \n\n- **Authentication**: Retrieve and refresh your TLS certificates. \n- **Private Docker images registry**: Create your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for your organization. \n- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues. \n- **Single Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review the `Public IP addresses` endpoints. \n- **Container Groups**: Create and manage your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.  \n- **Public IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container accessible from the internet. \n- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.  \n- **Volumes**: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist the data of your containers.  \n\n\n Each API request requires an HTTP header that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter. \n\n- **X-Auth-Token**: The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform. It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources. Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token information.\n- **X-Auth-Project-Id**: The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.\n\n\n For further information about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html.

    "description": "# Braze API Overview\n\nBraze provides a high performance REST API to allow you to track users, send messages, export data, and more.\n\nA REST API is a way to programmatically transfer information over the web using a predefined schema. Braze has created many different endpoints with specific requirements that will perform various actions and/or return various data. API access is done using HTTPS web requests to your company's REST API endpoint (this will correspond to your Dashboard URL as shown in the table below).\n\nCustomers using Braze's EU database should use `https://rest.fra-01.braze.eu/`. For more information on REST API endpoints for customers using Braze's EU database see our [EU/US Implementation Differences documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/eu01_us3_sdk_implementation_differences/overview/).\n\n## Braze Instances\n\nInstance    | Dashboard URL   | REST Endpoint\n----------- |---------------- | --------------------\nUS-01 | `https://dashboard.braze.com` or<br> `https://dashboard-01.braze.com` | `https://rest.iad-01.braze.com`\nUS-02 | `https://dashboard-02.braze.com` | `https://rest.iad-02.braze.com`\nUS-03 | `https://dashboard-03.braze.com` | `https://rest.iad-03.braze.com`\nUS-04 | `https://dashboard-04.braze.com` | `https://rest.iad-04.braze.com`\nUS-06 | `https://dashboard-06.braze.com` | `https://rest.iad-06.braze.com`\nEU-01 | `https://dashboard.braze.eu` or<br> `https://dashboard-01.braze.eu` | `https://rest.fra-01.braze.eu`\n\n\n# Using Braze's Postman Collection \n\nIf you have a Postman account (MacOS, Windows, and Linux versions can be downloaded from their website located [here](https://www.getpostman.com)), you can go to our Postman documentation and click the orange `Run in Postman` button in the top, right corner. This will allow you to [create an environment](#setting-up-your-postman-environment), as well as edit the available `POST` and `GET` requests to suit your own needs.\n\n## Setting Up Your Postman Environment\n\nThe Braze Postman Collection uses a templating variable, `{{instance_url}}`, to substitute the REST API URL of your Braze instance into the pre-built requests. Rather than having to manually edit all requests in the Collection, you can set up this variable in your Postman environment. To do so, please follow the steps below:\n\n1. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the Postman app. \n2. Select \"Manage Environments\" to open a modal window which displays your active environments.\n3. In the bottom right corner of the modal window, click \"Add\" to create a new environment.\n4. Give this environment a name (e.g. \"Braze API Requests\") and add keys for `instance_url` and `api_key` with values corresponding to [your Braze instance](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#endpoints) and [Braze REST API Key](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#app-group-rest-api-keys), as pictured below. \n\nAs of April, 2020 Braze has changed how we read App Group API keys. Instead of passing them in the request body or through url parameters, we now read the App Group Rest`api_key` through the HTTP Authorization header. API keys not passed through the HTTP Authorization Header will coninue to work until they have been sunset. \n\n## Using the Pre-Built Requests from the Collection\n\nOnce you have configured your environment. You can use any of the pre-built requests in the collection as a template for building new API requests. To start using one of the pre-built requests, simply click on it within the 'Collections' menu on the left side of Postman. This will open the request as a new tab in the main window of the Postman app.\n\nIn general, there are two types of requests that Braze's API endpoints accept - `GET` and `POST`. Depending on which `HTTP` method the endpoint uses, you'll need to edit the pre-built request differently.\n\n### Edit a POST Request\n\nWhen editing a `POST` request, you'll need to open the request and navigate to the `Body` section in the request editor. For readability, select the `raw` radio button to format the `JSON` request body.\n\n### Edit a GET Request\n\nWhen editing a `GET` request, you will need to edit the parameters passed in the request URL. To edit these easily, select the `Params` button next to the URL bar and edit the key-value pairs in the fields that will appear below the URL bar.\n\n## Send Your Request\n\nOnce your API request is ready to send, click on the 'Send' button next to the URL bar. The request will be sent and the response data will be populated in a section underneath the request editor. From here, you can view the raw data returned from Braze's API, see the HTTP response code, see how long the request took to process, and view header information.",

    "title": "BulkSMS JSON REST API",
    "description": "## Overview\n\nThe JSON REST API allows you to submit and receive [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com/) messages. You can also get access to past messages and see your account profile.\n\nThe base URL to use for this service is `https://api.bulksms.com/v1`.  The base URL cannot be used on its own; you must append a path that identifies an operation and you may have to specify some path parameters as well.\n\n[Click here](/developer/) to go to the main BulkSMS developer site.\n\nIn order to give you an idea on how the API can be used, some JSON snippets are provided below.  Have a look at the [messages section](#tag/Message) for more information.\n\nProbably the most simple example\n\n```\n{\n    \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\n\nYou can send unicode automatically using the `auto-unicode` query parameter. \nAlternatively, you can specify `UNICODE` for the `encoding` property in the request body. \nPlease note: when `auto-unicode` is specified and the value of the `encoding` property is `UNICODE`, the message will always be sent as `UNICODE`.\n\nHere is an example that sets the `encoding` explicitly\n\n```\n{\n  \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n  \"body\": \"Dobrá práce! Jak se máš?\",\n  \"encoding\": \"UNICODE\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can also specify a from number\n\n```\n{\n    \"from\": \"+27007654321\",\n    \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to above, but repliable\n\n```\n{\n    \"from\": { \"type\": \"REPLIABLE\" },\n    \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nA message to a group called Everyone\n\n```\n{\n    \"to\": { \"type\": \"GROUP\", \"name\": \"Everyone\" },\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nA message to multiple recipients\n\n```\n{\n    \"to\": [\"+27001234567\", \"+27002345678\", \"+27003456789\"],\n    \"body\": \"Happy Holidays!\"\n}\n```\n\nSending more than one message in the same request\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n        \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"to\": \"+27002345678\",\n        \"body\": \"Hello Universe!\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n**The insecure base URL `http://api.bulksms.com/v1` is deprecated** and may in future result in a `301` redirect response, or insecure requests may be rejected outright. Please use the secure (`https`) URI above.\n\n### HTTP Content Type\n\nAll API methods expect requests to supply a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. All responses will have the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.\n\n### JSON Formatting\n\nYou are advised to format your JSON resources according to strict JSON format rules. While the API does attempt to parse strictly invalid JSON documents, doing so may lead to incorrect interpretation and unexpected results.\n\nGood JSON libraries will produce valid JSON suitable for submission, but if you are manually generating the JSON text, be careful to follow the JSON format. This include correct escaping of control characters and double quoting of property names.\n\nSee the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627) for further information.\n\n### Date Formatting\n\nDates are formatted according to ISO-8601, such as `1970-01-01T10:00:00+01:00` for 1st January 1970, 10AM UTC+1.\n\nSee the [Wikipedia ISO 8601 reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further information.\n\nSpecifically, calendar dates are formatted with the 'extended' format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Basic format, week dates and ordinal dates are not supported. Times are also formatted in the 'extended' format `hh:mm:ss`. Hours, minutes and seconds are mandatory. Offset from UTC must be provided; this is to ensure that there is no misunderstanding regarding times provided to the API.\n\nThe format we look for is `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss[Z|[+-]hh:mm]`\n\nExamples of valid date/times are`2011-12-31T12:00:00Z` `2011-12-31T12:00:00+02:00`\n\n### Entity Format Modifications\n\nIt is expected that over time some changes will be made to the request and response formats of various methods available in the API.\nWhere possible, these will be implemented in a backwards compatible way.\nTo make this possible you are required to ignore unknown properties.\nThis enables the addition of information in response documents while maintaining compatibility with older clients.\n\n### Optional Request Entity Properties\n\nThere are many instances where requests can be made without having to specify every single property allowable in the request format.\nAny such optional properties are noted as such in the documentation and their default value is noted.\n",

Please update your applications accordingly. Check here: <https://github.com/bunq/sdk_php/issues/149> for more info.*\n\n***PSD2 NOTICE:*** *The second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) may affect your current or planned usage of our public API, as some of the API services are now subject to a permit. Please be aware that using our public API without the required PSD2 permit is at your own risk and take notice of our updated API Terms and Conditions on <https://www.bunq.com> for more information.*\n\n# <span id=\"topic-introduction\">Introduction</span>\n\nWelcome to bunq!\n\n- The bunq API is organised around REST. JSON will be returned in almost all responses from the API, including errors but excluding binary (image) files.\n- Please configure your implementation to send its API requests to `https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/`\n- There is a version of the [Android app](https://appstore.bunq.com/api/android/builds/bunq-android-sandbox-master.apk) that connects to the bunq Sandbox environment. To create accounts for the Sandbox app, please follow the steps in the [Android Emulator](#android-emulator) section.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-introduction-get-started\">Getting started</span>\n\nBefore you start sending API requests, you need to get an API key and activate it. API activation happens when you install the API key and link your IP address and device to it *(create an API context)*. The steps below will guide you through what you need to do to start sending custom API requests.\n\nHere is an overview of what you can use to get started with the bunq API: \n1. **Create an API key.** You can do it either in our [developer portal](https://developer.bunq.com) or in the bunq app *(Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys)*. If you want to test our sandbox first, our [bunq Developer ](https://developer.bunq.com)is the best place to start.\n2. **Register a device.** A device can be a phone (private), computer or a server (public). You can register a new device by using the `POST /installation` and `POST /device-server` calls. This will activate your API key. You only need to do this once.\n3. **Open a session.** Sessions are temporary and expire after the auto-logout time set for the user account. It can be changed by the account owner in the bunq app.\n4. **Make your first call!**\n\n![bunq_API_context](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/API-context.jpg)\n\n## <span id=\"topic-introduction-versioning\">Versioning</span>\n\nDevelopments in the financial sector, changing regulatory regimes and new feature requests require us to be flexible. This means we can iterate quickly to improve the API and related tooling. Therefore, we have chosen not to attach any version numbers to the changes just yet. \n\nWe will inform you in a timely manner of any important changes we make before they are deployed on together.bunq.com. You can also [subscribe to our API newsletter](https://bunq.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c00d0d6daea4e1cf7c863d52e&id=b08680cdc7) to make sure you don't miss any important updates. \n\n# <span id=\"topic-oauth\">OAuth</span>\n\n## <span id=\"topic-oauth-what-is-oauth\">What is OAuth?</span>\n\n[OAuth 2.0](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/getting-ready/) is a protocol that will let your app connect to bunq users in a safe and easy way. Please be aware that if you will gain access to the account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, [you may require a PSD2 permit](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/other/faq#can-we-use-the-bunq-api-to-offer-services-to-third-parties).\n\n## <span id=\"topic-oauth-get-started-with-oauth-for-bunq\">Get started with OAuth for bunq</span>\n\nTo initiate authorization into the bunq user accounts, you need to create an OAuth Client and register at least 1 redirect URL for it. \n\nYou can have 1 OAuth Client at a time. Reuse your OAuth credentials for every authorization request. \n\nThe list of steps below will help you to get started:\n\n1. Register an OAuth Client by creating an app in [bunq Developer](https://developer.bunq.com/portal)_._\n2. Add one or more Redirect URLs.\n3. Get your `client_id` and `secret` from your app information tab in [bunq Developer](https://developer.bunq.com/portal).\n4. Redirect your users to the [OAuth authorization request URL](#oauth-authorization-request).\n5. If the user accepts the authorization request, they will be redirected to the previously specified `redirect_uri` with an authorization `code` parameter.\n6. Use the [token endpoint](#oauth-token-exchange) to exchange the authorization `code` for an `access_token`.\n7. Use the `access_token` as a normal API Key. Open a session or use [our SDKs](https://github.com/bunq) to get started.\n\nYou can set up an OAuth Client and add redirect URLs to it using the dedicated endpoints too. Follow the flow below to do it programmatically.\n\nℹ️ As a PSD2 user, you cannot log in to the bunq app. You need to follow the flow below to register an OAuth Client for your application.\n\n![bunq_OAuth_credentials](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/create-oauth-credentials.jpg)\n\n## <span id=\"topic-oauth-what-can-my-apps-do-with-oauth\">What can my apps do with OAuth?</span>\n\nWe decided to launch OAuth with a default permission that allows you to perform the following actions:\n- read and create Monetary Accounts;\n- read Payments & Transactions;\n- create Payments between Monetary Accounts of the same user;\n- create Draft-Payments (the user will need to approve the payment using the bunq app);\n- assign a Monetary account to a Card;\n- read, create and manage Cards;\n- read and create Request-Inquiries\n- read Request-Responses.\n\nAs a PSD2-licensed developer, you are limited to the permission scopes of your role.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-oauth-authorization-request\">Authorization request</span>\n\nYour web or mobile app should redirect users to the following URL:\n\n`https://oauth.bunq.com/auth`\n\nThe following parameters should be passed:\n\n- `response_type` - bunq supports the authorization code grant, provide `code` as parameter (required)\n- `client_id` - your Client ID, get it from the bunq app (required)\n- `redirect_uri` - the URL you wish the user to be redirected after the authorization, make sure you register the Redirect URL in the bunq app (required)\n- `state` - a unique string to be passed back upon completion (optional)\n\nUse `https://oauth.sandbox.bunq.com/auth` in the sandbox environment.\n\n**Authorization request example:**\n\n```\nhttps://oauth.bunq.com/auth?response_type=code\n&client_id=1cc540b6e7a4fa3a862620d0751771500ed453b0bef89cd60e36b7db6260f813\n&redirect_uri=https://www.bunq.com\n&state=594f5548-6dfb-4b02-8620-08e03a9469e6\n```\n\n**Authorization request response:**\n\n```\nhttps://www.bunq.com/?code=7d272be434a75933f40c13d56aef6c31496005b653074f7d6ac57029d9995d30\n&state=594f5548-6dfb-4b02-8620-08e03a9469e6\n\n```\n\n![bunq_OAuth_authorization_token_exchange.jpg](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/Authorization-token-exchange.jpg)\n\n## <span id=\"topic-oauth-token-exchange\">Token exchange</span>\n\nIf the authorization request is accepted by the user, you get the authorization `code`_._ Exchange it for an `access_token`.\n\nMake a `POST` call to `https://api.oauth.bunq.com/v1/token` . Pass the following parameters as `GET` variables:\n\n- `grant_type` - the grant type used, `authorization_code` for now (required)\n- `code` -  the authorization code received from bunq (required)\n- `redirect_uri` - the same Redirect URL used in the authorisation request (required)\n- `client_id` - your Client ID (required)\n- `client_secret` - your Client Secret (required)\n\nUse `https://api-oauth.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/token` in the sandbox environment.\n\n**Token request example:**\n\n```\nhttps://api.oauth.bunq.com/v1/token?grant_type=authorization_code\n&code=7d272be434a75933f40c13d56aef6c31496005b653074f7d6ac57029d9995d30\n&redirect_uri=https://www.bunq.com/\n&client_id=1cc540b6e7a4fa3a862620d0751771500ed453b0bef89cd60e36b7db6260f813\n&client_secret=184f969765f6f74f53bf563ae3e9f891aec9179157601d25221d57f2f1151fd5\n```\n\nNote: The request should only contain URL parameters. No body is expected.\n\n**Example successful response:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"access_token\": \"8baec0ac1aafca3345d5b811042feecfe0272514c5d09a69b5fbc84cb1c06029\",\n    \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n    \"state\": \"594f5548-6dfb-4b02-8620-08e03a9469e6\"\n}\n```\n\n**Example error response:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"error\": \"invalid_grant\",\n    \"error_description\": \"The authorization code is invalid or expired.\"\n}\n```\n\n## <span id=\"topic-oauth-whats-next\">What's next?</span>\n\nTo start sending calls to the account of the user who has accepted your authorization request, create an API context for the `access_token` you have received as the result of the token exchange. The `access_token` can be used as a normal API key. Please continue with [Authentication](#authentication).\n\n**NOTE:** When connecting to a bunq user's account using OAuth, you create a new user \\(`userApiKey`\\) that has its own `id` and `access_token` . When sending a request on behalf of a user connected to your app via OAuth,  use the `id` of `userApiKey`  as `userId` and the item `id`s of the bunq user \\(`grantedByUser`\\).\n\n**Example of a successful request URL:**\n\n```text\nhttps://api.bunq.com/user/{userApiKey's userId}/monetary-account/{grantedByUser's monetary-accountId}/payment\n```\n\nWhen calling `GET /user/{userID}`, you might expect to get `UserPerson` or `UserCompany`. Instead, you will get the `UserApiKey` object, which contains references to both the user that requested access *(you)* and the user that granted access *(the bunq user account that you connected to)*. \n\n![bunq_OAuth UserApiKey](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LbhJLuxCAKl5yUuS74T%2F-LuhS4YOAX9bwW1eGYF8%2F-LuhnlwEcVXtLVk6846Z%2FUserApiKey%20creation%20(3).jpg?alt=media&token=d1f212a2-3105-4f0e-a980-34b04a12998a)\n\n## <span id=\"topic-oauth-using-the-connect-button\">Using the Connect button</span>\n\nAll good? Ready to connect to your bunq users? Refer to our style guide and use the following assets when implementing the **Connect to bunq** button.\n\n- [Style guide](https://bunq.com/info/oauth-styleguide)\n- [Connect button assets](https://bunq.com/info/oauth-connect-buttons)\n\nVisit us on together.bunq.com, share your creations, ask question and build your very own bunq app!\n\n# <span id=\"topic-authentication\">Authentication</span>\n\n- All requests must use HTTPS. HTTP calls will fail. \n- You should use SSL Certificate Pinning and Hostname Verification to ensure your connection with bunq is secure.\n- The auto logout time that you set in the app applies to all your sessions including the API ones. If a request is made 30 minutes before a session expires, the session will automatically be extended.\n- We use extra signing on top of HTTPS encryption that you must implement yourself if you are not using the SDKs.\n\nℹ️ *We use asymmetric cryptography for signing requests and encryption.*\n- The client (you) and the server (bunq) must have a pair of keys: a private key and a public key. You need to pre-generate your own pair of 2048-bit RSA keys in the PEM format aligned with the PKCS #8 standard.\n- The parties (you and bunq) exchange their public keys in the first step of the API context creation flow. All the following requests must be signed by both your application and the server. Pass your signature in the `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` header, and the server will return its signature in the `X-Bunq-Server-Signature` header.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-authentication-device-registration\">Device registration</span>\n\nBefore you can start calling the bunq API, you must activate your API key, which covers the following steps:\n* register your API key, device, and IP address\\(es\\) _\\(only once to activate your API key\\);_\n* create a session via `POST /session-server`. \n\nWe call this sequence of steps \"creating an API context.\" \n\nIf you are using OAuth to access a user account, you need to create an API context for the `access_token` you receive upon [authorization token exchange](https://doc.bunq.com/#/oauth) too. \n\n### <span id=\"topic-authentication-device-registration-using-our-sdks\">Using our SDKs</span>\n\n1. Go to our [GitHub](https://github.com/bunq) page.\n2. Choose the SDK in your language of choice.\n3. Find and use the part dedicated to creating an API context.\n\n[Run Tinker](https://developer.bunq.com/tinker-command-line-banking) to see a sample project using bunq SDKs in action.\n\n\n### <span id=\"topic-authentication-device-registration-using-our-api\">Using our API directly</span>\n\n1. Create an _Installation_ by calling `POST v1/installation` and passing your pre-generated public key. You will receive an installation _Token._ Use it when making the two following API calls.\n2. Create a _DeviceServer_ via `POST v1/device-server`. Provide a description and a secret \\(API key in this case\\).\n3. Create a _SessionServer_ by executing `POST v1/session-server`. You will receive an authentication _Token._ Use it in the API requests in this active session.​\n\n[Import our Postman collection](https://github.com/bunq/postman) to see our pre-setup API context creation calls. It will automatically generate and pre-fill everything in the API calls that create context so you can inspect the process.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-authentication-device-registration-ip-addresses\">IP addresses</span>\n\nWhen using a standard API Key the DeviceServer and Installation that are created in this process are bound to the IP address they are created from. Afterwards it is only possible to add IP addresses via the Permitted IP endpoint.\n\nUsing a Wildcard API Key gives you the freedom to make API calls from any IP address after the POST device-server. You can switch to a Wildcard API Key by tapping on “Allow All IP Addresses” in your API Key menu inside the bunq app. You can also programatically switch to a Wildcard API Key by passing your current ip and a `*` (asterisk) in the `permitted_ips` field of the device-server POST call. E.g: `[\"1.2.3.4\", \"*\"]`.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-psd2\">Connect as a PSD2 service provider</span>\n\nAs a service provider, either an Account Information Service Provider (AISP), Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP), or Card Based Payment Instrument Issuer (CBPII), you have obtained or are planning to obtain a license from your local supervisor. You will need your unique eIDAS certificate number to start using the PSD2-compliant bunq API on production.\n\nWe accept pseudo certificates in the sandbox environment so you could test the flow. You can generate a test certificate using the command below.\n\n⚠️ Make sure to include AISP and/or PISP in the name to generate a certificate with the roles.\n\n```\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=My App PISP AISP/C=NL'\n```\n\n## <span id=\"topic-psd2-register-as-a-service-provider\">Register as a service provider</span>\n\nBefore you can read the information on bunq users or initiate payments, you need to register a PSD2 account and receive credentials that will enable you to access the bunq user accounts.\n\n1. Execute `POST v1/installation` and get your installation *Token* with a unique random key pair.\n1. Use the installation *Token* and your unique PSD2 certificate to call `POST v1/payment-service-provider-credential`. This will register your software. \n1. Receive your API key in return. It will identify you as a PSD2 bunq API user. You will use it to start an OAuth flow. The session will last 90 days. After it closes, start a new session using the same API key.\n1. Register a device by using `POST v1/device-server` using the API key for the secret and passing the installation *Token* in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header. \n1. Create your first session by executing `POST v1/session-server`. Provide the installation *Token* in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header. You will receive a session *Token*. Use it in any following request in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header.\n\n**NOTE.** The first session will last 1 hour. Start a new session within 60 minutes.\n\n![bunq_PSD2_API_context](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/Creating-API-context-as-a-PSD2-user-REVISED.jpg)\n\n## <span id=\"topic-psd2-register-your-applicaton\">Register your OAuth application</span>\n\nBefore you can start authenticating on behalf of a bunq user, you need to get *Client ID* and *Client Secret*, which will identify you in authorization requests to the user accounts.\n\n1. Call `POST /v1/user/{userID}/oauth-client` to create an OAuth Client.\n2. Add a redirect URL to the OAuth Client via `POST /user/{userID}/oauth-client/{oauth-clientID}/callback-url`.\n3. Call `GET /v1/user/{userID}/oauth-client/{oauth-clientID}`. We will return your _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_.\n4. You are ready to [initiate authorization requests](#oauth-authorization-request).\n\nThe flow below will guide you through the full OAuth connection process. Note that you only need to create OAuth credentials once.\n\n![bunq_full_OAuth_flow](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/AuthorizationOAuth-Flow.jpg)\n\n## <span id=\"topic-psd2-access-user-accounts-as-an-aisp\">Access user accounts as an AISP</span>\n\nAs an AISP, you are allowed to authenticate in a user’s account and access \\(read\\) the following account information:\n\n1. legal name\n2. IBAN\n3. nationality\n4. card validity data\n5. transaction history\n6. account balance\n\nTo read the user's information, you need to establish a connection with their bunq account. You can do it using an [authorization request](#oauth-authorization-request). Once a bunq user has confirmed the authorization request and you have done the [token exchange](#oauth-token-exchange), you can activate the Access Token \\(use it as an API key\\).\n\nToken activation happens when you create an API context \\(install it and link your IP adrress and device to it\\). See the [OAuth](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/basics/oauth) page for the full flow illustration.\n\nAn active Access Token allows you to communicate with the bunq user’s account. You can use it to start a session to interact with the monetary accounts the user allows you to access.\n\n![bunq_AISP](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/AISP.jpg)\n\n## <span id=\"topic-psd2-initiate-payments-as-a-pisp\">Make payments as a PISP</span>\n\nAs a PISP, you are allowed to authenticate in a user’s account with the following permissions:\nread account information \\(via`GET /user`\\):\n   * legal name;\n   * IBAN;\n2. initiate payments \\(create draft payments via either  `POST /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/draft-payment` or `POST /user/{userID}/payment-service-provider-draft-payment`\\) and read their statuses;\n3. confirm that the account balance is sufficient for covering the payment \\(via`POST /user/{userID}/confirmation-of-funds`\\).\n\nThe bunq API provides endpoints for different scenarios of the implementation of the payment initiation functionality. In particular, as a PISP user, you can build applications that initiate and authorize one-off or multiple incoming payments. Depending on the use case you are intending to deploy, you might need to initiate the OAuth authorization either before or after the payment initiation.  \n\n### <span id=\"topic-psd2-initiate-multiple-payments-as-a-pisp\">Authorization of multiple (scheduled) payments</span>\n\nIt is possible to initiate payments from a bunq user's account having previously established an OAuth connection between your application and the bunq user's account. The bunq user will receive push notifications for each initiated payment.\n\nOnce a bunq user has [confirmed they want to make payments via your application](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/psd2/connect-as-a-psd2-service-provider#register-your-application), you can initiate the payment confirmation flow.\n\n1. Create a draft payment via `POST /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/draft-payment`passing the following parameters:\n   * `monetary-accountId and userId` (`userApiKey`'s `id`; see [OAuth](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/basics/oauth#user-id-vs-item-ids) for more information) in the endpoint URL;\n   * the customer’s email address, phone number, or IBAN in the `counterparty_alias` field of the request body.\n2. If the user confirms their intent to make the payment, bunq carries out the transaction.\n3. Check the status of the payment via `GET /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/draft-payment` using the draft payment `id` parameter returned in the previous step. \n\n![bunq_PISP](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/Payment-initiation-1.1-universal.jpg)\n\n### <span id=\"topic-psd2-initiate-single-payments-as-a-pisp\">Single payment authorization</span>\n\nIt is possible to initiate payments having only the IBAN of the payer using `POST /user/{userID}/payment-service-provider-draft-payment`.  In this case, the bunq user will accept the payment along with the authorization request. No additional push notifications are sent to the user. \n\n1. Collect the bunq user's IBAN (and name) in the UI of your application.\n2. Create a draft payment via `POST /user/{userID}/payment-service-provider-draft-payment`. \n3. Initiate an [authorization request.](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/basics/oauth#authorization-request) Upon the QR-code scan, the bunq user will see and be able to either accept or reject the payment authorization request.\n4. Check the status of the payment.\n\n![bunq_PISP_single_payment](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/Payment-initiation-1.0.jpg)\n\n## <span id=\"topic-psd2-confirm-available-funds-as-a-cbpii\">Confirm available funds as a CBPII</span>\n\nAs a CBPII, you are allowed to authenticate in a user’s account to validate the availability of funds for the payment in question. \n\n1. Collect an alias for the bunq user's account (their name and IBAN, email address, or phone number).\n2. Check the availability of funds via `POST /user/{userID}/confirmation-of-funds` passing the following information:\n   * your `userId`;\n   * the amount of money needed for the payment;\n   * the name of the bunq user and the IBAN of the account (email address or phone number pointing at the user are also possible).\n\n# <span id=\"topic-signing\">Signing</span>\n⚠️ **NOTE:**  We deprecated the signing of the entire API request (the URL, headers and body). You only need to sign the request body. Requests with full request signatures are no longer validated.\n\nWe are legally required to protect our users and their data from malicious attacks and intrusions. That is why we beyond having a secure https connection, we use [asymmetric cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) for signing requests that create a session or payment. The use of signatures ensures the data is coming from the trusted party and was not modified after sending and before receiving.\n\nRequest body signing is only mandatory for the following operations: \n- open a session;\n- create a payment;\n- create a scheduled payment;\n- any other operation that executes a payment such as the following:\n\t- accept a draft payment;\n\t- accept a scheduled payment;\n\t- accept a draft scheduled payment;\n\t- accept a payment request.\n\nYou will know that the API call must be encrypted if you get the 466 error code. \n\nThe signing mechanism is implemented in our [SDKs](https://github.com/bunq) so if you are using them you don't have to worry about the details described below.\n\nThe signatures are created using the SHA256 cryptographic hash function and included (encoded in base 64) in the `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` request header and `X-Bunq-Server-Signature` response header. The data to sign is the following:\n\n- For requests: the body only.\n- For responses: the body only.\n\nFor signing requests, the client must use the private key corresponding to the public key that was sent to the server in the installation API call. That public key is what the server will use to verify the signature when it receives the request. In that same call the server will respond with a server side public key, which the client must use to verify the server's signatures. The generated RSA key pair must have key lengths of 2048 bits and adhere to the PKCS #8 standard.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-signing-request-signing-example\">Request signing example</span>\n\nConsider the following request, a `POST` to `/v1/user/126/monetary-account/222/payment` (the JSON is formatted with newlines and indentations to make it more readable):\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Header</th>\n            <th>Value</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cache-Control:</td>\n            <td>no-cache</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>User-Agent:</td>\n            <td>bunq-TestServer/1.00 sandbox/0.17b3</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>X-Bunq-Client-Authentication:</td>\n\n<td>f15f1bbe1feba25efb00802fa127042b54101c8ec0a524c36464f5bb143d3b8b</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"amount\": {\n\t\t\"value\": \"12.50\",\n\t\t\"currency\": \"EUR\"\n\t},\n\t\"counterparty_alias\": {\n\t\t\"type\": \"EMAIL\",\n\t\t\"value\": \"bravo@bunq.com\"\n\t},\n\t\"description\": \"Payment for drinks.\"\n}\n```\n\nLet's sign that request. First create a variable `$dataToSign` containing the body of the request:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"amount\": {\n        \"value\": \"12.50\",\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\"\n    },\n    \"counterparty_alias\": {\n        \"type\": \"EMAIL\",\n        \"value\": \"bravo@bunq.com\"\n    },\n    \"description\": \"Payment for drinks.\"\n}\n```\nNext, create the signature of `$dataToSign` using the SHA256 algorithm and the private key `$privateKey` of the Installation's key pair. In PHP, use the following to create a signature. The signature will be passed by reference into `$signature`.\n\n`openssl_sign($dataToSign, $signature, $privateKey, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);`\n\nEncode the resulting `$signature` using base64, and add the resulting value to the request under the `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` header. You have just signed your request, and can send it!\n\n## <span id=\"topic-signing-response-verifying-example\">Response verifying example</span>\n\nThe response to the previous request is as follows (the JSON is formatted with newlines and indentations to make it more readable):\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Header</th>\n            <th>Value</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Access-Control-Allow-Origin:</td>\n            <td>*</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Content-Type:</td>\n            <td>application/json</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Date:</td>\n            <td>Thu, 07 Apr 2016 08:32:04 GMT</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Server:</td>\n            <td>APACHE</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Strict-Transport-Security:</td>\n            <td>max-age=31536000</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Transfer-Encoding:</td>\n            <td>chunked</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>X-Bunq-Client-Response-Id:</td>\n            <td>89dcaa5c-fa55-4068-9822-3f87985d2268</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id:</td>\n            <td>57061b04b67ef</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>X-Bunq-Server-Signature:</td>\n            <td>ee9sDfzEhQ2L6Rquyh2XmJyNWdSBOBo6Z2eUYuM4bAOBCn9N5vjs6k6RROpagxXFXdGI9sT15tYCaLe5FS9aciIuJmrVW/SZCDWq/nOvSThi7+BwD9JFdG7zfR4afC8qfVABmjuMrtjaUFSrthyHS/5wEuDuax9qUZn6sVXcgZEq49hy4yHrV8257I4sSQIHRmgds4BXcGhPp266Z6pxjzAJbfyzt5JgJ8/suxgKvm/nYhnOfsgIIYCgcyh4DRrQltohiSon6x1ZsRIfQnCDlDDghaIxbryLfinT5Y4eU1eiCkFB4D69S4HbFXYyAxlqtX2W6Tvax6rIM2MMPNOh4Q==</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>X-Frame-Options:</td>\n            <td>SAMEORIGIN</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"Response\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"Id\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"id\": 1561\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\nWe need to verify that this response was sent by the bunq server and not from a man-in-the-middle:\n- Create a `$dataToSign` variable containing the body of the request.\n\n**NOTE:** We started to only sign the response body on April 28, 2020. Please make sure you validate our new response signature.\n\nSo for our example above the response to sign will look like this:\n\n```\n{\"Response\":[{\"Id\":{\"id\":1561}}]}\n```\nNow, verify the signature of `$dataToVerify` using the SHA256 algorithm and the public key `$publicKey` of the server. In PHP, use the following to verify the signature.\n\n`openssl_sign($dataToVerify, $signature, $publicKey, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);`\n\n## <span id=\"topic-signing-troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</span>\n\nIf you get an error telling you \"The request signature is invalid\", please check the following:\n\n- There are no redundant characters (extra spaces, trailing line breaks, etc.) in the data to sign.\n- Make sure the body is appended to the data to sign exactly as you're adding it to the request.\n- You have added the full body to the data to sign.\n- You use the data to sign to create a SHA256 hash signature.\n- You have base64 encoded the SHA256 hash signature before adding it to the request under `X-Bunq-Client-Signature`.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-headers\">Headers</span>\n\nHTTP headers allow your client and bunq to pass on additional information along with the request or response.\n\nWhile this is already implemented in our [SDKs](https://github.com/bunq), please follow these instructions to make sure you set appropriate headers for calls if using bunq API directly.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-headers-request-headers\">Request headers</span>\n\n### <span id=\"topic-headers-request-headers-mandatory-request-headers\">Mandatory request headers</span>\n\n#### Cache-Control\n\n`Cache-Control: no-cache`\n\nThe standard HTTP Cache-Control header is required for all requests.\n\n#### User-Agent\n\n`User-Agent: bunq-TestServer/1.00 sandbox/0.17b3`\n\nThe User-Agent header field should contain information about the user agent originating the request. There are no restrictions on the value of this header.\n\n#### X-Bunq-Client-Signature\n\n**⚠️ UPCOMING CHANGE:** Header and URL signature will stop being validated on April 28, 2020.

It is required by all API calls except for `POST /v1/installation`. \n\nIt is important to note that the device and session calls are using the token from the response of the installation call, while all the other calls use the token from the response of the session-server call:\n- Pass the **installation *Token*** you get in the response to the `POST /installation` call in the `/device-server` and `/session-server` calls.\n- Pass the **session *Token*** you get in the response to the `POST /session-server` call in all the other calls.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-headers-request-headers-otpional-request-headers\">Optional request headers</span>\n\n#### X-Bunq-Language\n\n`X-Bunq-Language: en_US`\n\n`en_US` is the default language setting for responses and error descriptions.\n\nThe X-Bunq-Language header must contain a preferred language indication. The value of this header is formatted as a ISO 639-1 language code plus a ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, separated by an underscore.\n\nCurrently only the languages en_US and nl_NL are supported. Anything else will default to en_US.\n\n#### X-Bunq-Region\n\n`X-Bunq-Region: en_US`\n\n`en_US` is the default region for localization formatting.\n\nThe X-Bunq-Region header must contain the region (country) of the client device. The value of this header is formatted as a ISO 639-1 language code plus a ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, separated by an underscore.\n\n#### X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id\n\n`X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id: a4f0de`\n\nThis header has to specify an ID with each request that is unique for the logged in user. There are no restrictions for the format of this ID. However, the server will respond with an error when the same ID is used again on the same DeviceServer.\n\n#### X-Bunq-Geolocation\n\n`X-Bunq-Geolocation: 4.89 53.2 12 100 NL`\n\n`X-Bunq-Geolocation: 0 0 0 0 000` *(if no geolocation is available or known)*\n\nThis header has to specify the geolocation of the device. It makes it possible for bunq to map the geolocation with the payment.\n‌\nThe format of this value is longitude latitude altitude radius country. The country is expected to be formatted of an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. When no geolocation is available or known the header must still be included but can be zero valued.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-headers-request-headers-attachment-headers\">Attachment headers</span>\n\n#### Content-Type\n\n`Content-Type: image/jpeg`\n\nThis header should be used when uploading an attachment to pass its MIME type.

If this is the case, please stop by the support chat and report it to us.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-errors-response-codes\">Response codes</span>\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Code</th>\n            <th>Error</th>\n            <th>Description</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>200</td>\n            <td>OK</td>\n            <td>Successful HTTP request</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>399</td>\n            <td>NOT MODIFIED</td>\n            <td>Same as a 304, it implies you have a local cached copy of the data</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>400</td>\n            <td>BAD REQUEST</td>\n            <td>Most likely a parameter is missing or invalid</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>401</td>\n            <td>UNAUTHORISED</td>\n            <td>Token or signature provided is not valid</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>403</td>\n            <td>FORBIDDEN</td>\n            <td>You're not allowed to make this call</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>404</td>\n            <td>NOT FOUND</td>\n            <td>The object you're looking for cannot be found</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>405</td>\n            <td>METHOD NOT ALLOWED</td>\n            <td>The method you are using is not allowed for this endpoint</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>429</td>\n            <td>RATE LIMIT</td>\n            <td>Too many API calls have been made in a too short period</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>466</td>\n            <td>REQUEST SIGNATURE REQUIRED</td>\n            <td>Request signature is required for this operation.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>490</td>\n            <td>USER ERROR</td>\n            <td>Most likely a parameter is missing or invalid</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>491</td>\n            <td>MAINTENANCE ERROR</td>\n            <td>bunq is in maintenance mode</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>500</td>\n            <td>INTERNAL SERVER ERROR</td>\n            <td>Something went wrong on bunq's end</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nAll errors 4xx code errors will include a JSON body explaining what went wrong.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-errors-rate-limits\">Rate limits</span>\n\nIf you are receiving the error 429, please make sure you are sending requests at rates that are below our rate limits.\n\nOur rate limits per IP address per endpoint:\n\n- GET requests: 3 within any 3 consecutive seconds\n- POST requests: 5 within any 3 consecutive seconds\n- PUT requests: 2 within any 3 consecutive seconds\n- Callbacks: 2 callback URLs per notification category\n\nWe have a lower rate limit for `/session-server`: 1 request within 30 consecutive seconds.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-api-conventions\">API conventions</span>\n\nMake sure to follow these indications when using the bunq API or get started with our SDKs.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-api-conventions-responses\">Responses</span>\n\nAll JSON responses have one top level object. In this object will be a Response field of which the value is always an array, even for responses that only contain one object.\n\nExample response body\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"Response\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"DataObject\": {}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\n## <span id=\"topic-api-conventions-errors\">Errors</span>\n\n- Error responses also have one top level Error object.\n- The contents of the array will be a JSON object with an error_description and error_description_translated field.\n- The error_description is an English text indicating the error and the error_description_translated field can be shown to end users and is translated into the language from the X-Bunq-Language header, defaulting to en_US.\n- When using bunq SDKs, error responses will be always raised in form of an exception.\n\nExample response body\n```json\n{\n\t\"Error\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"error_description\": \"Error description\",\n\t\t\t\"error_description_translated\": \"User facing error description\"\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\n## <span id=\"topic-api-conventionsobject-type-indications\">Object Type indications</span>\n\nWhen the API returns different types of objects for the same field, they will be nested in another JSON object that includes a specific field for each one of them. Within bunq SDKs a BunqResponse object will be returned as the top level object.\n\nIn this example there is a field content, which can have multiple types of objects as value such as — in this case — ChatMessageContentText. Be sure to follow this convention or use bunq SDKs instead.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"content\": {\n\t\t\"ChatMessageContentText\": {\n\t\t\t\"text\": \"Hi! This is an automated security message. We saw you just logged in on an My Device Description. If you believe someone else logged in with your account, please get in touch with Support.\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## <span id=\"topic-api-conventions-time-formats\">Time formats</span>\n\nTimes and dates being sent to and from the API are in UTC. The format that should be used is `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.ssssss`, where the letters have the meaning as specified in ISO 8601. For example: `2017-01-13 13:19:16.215235`.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-callbacks\">Callbacks</span>\n\nCallbacks are used to send information about events on your bunq account to a URL of your choice, so that you can receive real-time updates.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-callbacks-notification-filters\">Notification Filters</span>\n\nTo receive notifications for certain activities on a bunq account, you have to create notification filters. It is possible to send the notifications to a provided URL and/or the user’s phone as push notifications.\n\nUse the `notification-filter-push` resource to create and manage push notification filters. Provide the type of events you want to receive notifications about in the `category` field. \n\n```json    \n{\n   \"notification_filters\":[\n      {\n         \"category\":\"SCHEDULE_RESULT\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nUse the `notification-filter-url` resource to create and manage URL notification filters. The callback URL you provide in the `notification_target` field must use HTTPS. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"notification_filters\":[\n      {\n         \"category\":\"PAYMENT\",\n         \"notification_target\":\"{YOUR_CALLBACK_URL}\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\n### <span id=\"topic-callbacks-notification-filters-callback-categories\">Callback categories</span>\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Category</th>\n            <th>Description</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>BILLING</td>\n            <td>notifications for all bunq invoices</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>CARD_TRANSACTION_SUCCESSFUL</td>\n            <td>notifications for successful card transactions</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>CARD_TRANSACTION_FAILED</td>\n            <td>notifications for failed card transaction</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>CHAT</td>\n            <td>notifications for received chat messages</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>DRAFT_PAYMENT</td>\n            <td>notifications for creation and updates of draft payments</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>IDEAL</td>\n            <td>notifications for iDEAL-deposits towards a bunq account</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>SOFORT</td>\n            <td>notifications for SOFORT-deposits towards a bunq account</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>MUTATION</td>\n            <td>notifications for any action that affects a monetary account’s balance</td>\n        </tr>\n\t<tr>\n            <td>OAUTH</td>\n            <td>notifications for revoked OAuth connections</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>PAYMENT</td>\n            <td>notifications for payments created from, or received on a bunq account (doesn’t include payments that result out of paying a Request, iDEAL, Sofort or Invoice).

So, for each payment-like object, such as a request, iDEAL-payment or a regular payment, a Mutation is created. Therefore, the `MUTATION` category can be used to keep track of a monetary account's balance.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-callbacks-notification-filters-receiving-callbacks\">Receiving callbacks</span>\n\nCallbacks for the sandbox environment will be made from different IP's at AWS.  \nCallbacks for the production environment will be made from `185.40.108.0/22`.\n\n*The IP addresses might change*. We will notify you in a timely fashion if such a change would take place.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-callbacks-notification-filters-retry-mechanism\">Retry mechanism</span>\n\nWhen the execution of a callback fails (e.g. if the callback server is down or the response contains an error) it is tried again for a maximum of 5 times, with an interval of one minute between each try. If your server is not reachable by the callback after the 6th total try, the callback is not sent anymore.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-callbacks-notification-filters-removing-callbacks\">Removing callbacks</span>\n\nTo remove callbacks for an object, send a PUT request to the *user-person*, *user-company*, *monetary-account* or *cash-register* resource with the `notification_filters` field of the JSON request body unset.\n```\n{\n    \"notification_filters\": []\n}\n```\n\n## <span id=\"topic-callbacks-certificate-pinning\">Certificate pinning</span>\n\nWe recommend you use certificate pinning as an extra security measure. With certificate pinning, we check the certificate of the server on which you want to receive callbacks against the pinned certificate that has been provided by you and cancel the callback if that check fails.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-callbacks-certificate-pinning-how-to-set-up-certificate-pinning\">How to set up certificate pinning</span>\n\nRetrieve the SSL certificate of your server using the following command:\n\n1. `openssl s_client -servername www.example.com -connect www.example.com:443 < /dev/null | sed -n \"/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p\" > www.example.com.pem`\n2. `POST` the certificate to the certificate-pinned endpoint.\n\nNow every callback that is made will be checked against the pinned certificate that you provided. Note that if the SSL certificate on your server expires or is changed, our callbacks will fail.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-pagination\">Pagination</span>\n\nIn order to control the size of the response of a `LIST` request, items can be paginated. A `LIST` request is a request for every one of a certain resources, for instance all payments of a certain monetary account `GET /v1/user/1/monetary-account/1/payment`). You can decide on the maximum amount of items of a response by adding a `count` query parameter with the number of items you want per page to the URL. For instance:\n\n`GET /v1/user/1/monetary-account/1/payment?count=25`\n\nWhen no `count` is given, the default count is set to 10. The maximum `count` you can set is 200.\n\nWith every listing, a `Pagination` object will be added to the response, containing the URLs to be used to get the next or previous set of items. The URLs in the Pagination object can be used to navigate through the listed resources. The Pagination object looks like this given a count of 25:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Pagination\": {\n        \"future_url\": null,\n        \"newer_url\": \"/v1/user/1/monetary-account/1/payment?count=25&newer_id=249\",\n        \"older_url\": \"/v1/user/1/monetary-account/1/payment?count=25&older_id=224\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `newer_url` value can be used to get the next page. The `newer_id` is always the ID of the last item in the current page. If `newer_url` is `null`, there are no more recent items before the current page.\n\nThe `older_url` value can be used to get the previous page. The `older_id` is always the ID of the first item in the current page. If `older_url` is `null`, there are no older items after the current page.\n\nThe `future_url` can be used to refresh and check for newer items that didn't exist when the listing was requested. The `newer_id` will always be the ID of the last item in the current page. `future_url` will be `null` if `newer_id` is not also the ID of the latest item.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-sandbox\">Sandbox</span>\n*The sandbox base URL is https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/*\n\nWe do not use real money and do not allow external transactions in the sandbox environment. \n\n## Sandbox user accounts\nYou need to create a sandbox user to test the bunq API. The easiest way to do it is by using [our developer portal](https://developer.bunq.com/):\n1. Log in using your bunq account or [create a free developer account](https://developer.bunq.com/portal/signup) with sandbox-only access.\n1. Go to Sandbox Users.\n1. Generate up to 5 users.\n1. Use the sandbox API key to create an API context and/or use the user credentials to log in to the [sandbox bunq app](https://doc.bunq.com/#/android-emulator).\n\n### Alternative ways to generate sandbox API keys\nThere are 3 other ways you can generate a bunq sandbox API key:\n* connect to [Tinker](https://lexy.gitbook.io/bunq/quickstart/tinker) *(it will also return login credentials for the sandbox app)*;\n* create it in the [sandbox app](https://doc.bunq.com/#/android-emulator) *(you need to be logged in as a sandbox user)*;\n* call the sandbox user endpoints directly, using [our Postman collection](https://github.com/bunq/postman), or by running a cURL command (change `sandbox-user-person` to `sandbox-user-company` to generate a business user):\n\n```\ncurl https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/sandbox-user-person -X POST --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" --header \"Cache-Control: none\" --header \"User-Agent: curl-request\" --header \"X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id: $(date)randomId\" --header \"X-Bunq-Language: nl_NL\" --header \"X-Bunq-Region: nl_NL\" --header \"X-Bunq-Geolocation: 0 0 0 0 000\"\n```\n\n⚠️ **NOTE:** An API key can only be assigned to an IP within 1 hour after its creation. After the 1 hour, it will become invalid if not assigned. API keys that are created via the sandbox app are wiped with each sandbox reset.\n\nOnce you have a sandbox API key, create more sandbox users to use as test customer accounts, and start playing with the API. \n\nThe sandbox base URL is https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/.\n\n## Sandbox money\nWithout money, it's not always sunny in the sandbox world. Fortunately, getting money on the bunq sandbox is easy. All you need to do is ask Sugar Daddy for it.\n\nSend a `POST v1/request-inquiry` request passing sugardaddy@bunq.com  in the counterparty_alias field. Specify the type for the alias and set the `allow_bunqme` field. Request up to €500 at a time.\n```\n{\n    \"amount_inquired\": {\n        \"value\": \"100\",\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\"\n    },\n    \"counterparty_alias\": {\n        \"type\": \"EMAIL\",\n        \"value\": \"sugardaddy@bunq.com\",\n        \"name\": \"Sugar Daddy\"\n    },\n    \"description\": \"You're the best!\",\n    \"allow_bunqme\": false\n}\n```\n\n# <span id=\"topic-android-emulator\">Android Emulator</span>\n\nIn case you do not own an Android device on which you can run our Sandbox app for end-to-end testing, you can set up an emulator to run the bunq Sandbox app for Android.\n\n## Things you will need\n\n- The [bunq Sandbox App APK](https://appstore.bunq.com/api/android/builds/bunq-android-sandbox-master.apk) that's optimised for emulating;\n- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).\n\n## Starting the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager\n\n1. Open Android Studio.\n2. From the top menu, select “Tools” > \"Android\" > \"AVD Manager\".\n\n## Setting up a new virtual device\n\n1. Start the wizard by clicking on \"+ Create Virtual Device\".\n2. Select a device (recommendation: \"Pixel 5.0\" or \"Nexus 6\") and press \"Next\".\n3. Select an x86 system image (recommendation: Nougat, API Level 25, Android 7.1.1 with Google APIs) and press \"Next\". The image needs to have Google Play Services 10.0.1 or higher.\n4. In the bottom left corner, select \"Show Advanced Settings\".\n5. Scroll to \"Memory and Storage\".\n6. Change \"Internal Storage\" to \"2048 MB\".\n7. Change \"SD card\" to \"200 MB\".\n8. Press \"Finish\".\n\n## Starting the virtual device\n\n1. On the right side under \"Actions\", select the green \"Play\" button.\n2. Wait for the device to boot, this may take a few minutes.\n\n## Installing the bunq Sandbox App APK\n\n1. Open the command line.\n2. Navigate to your Android SDK platform tools directory (e.g. `cd ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools` on macOS).\n3. Make sure that the virtual device is started and has fully booted.\n4. Run `./adb install ~/Downloads/bunq-android-sandboxEmulator-public-api.apk`, this may take a few minutes, and should finish with \"Success\".\n\n## Creating an account or logging in\n\n1. Create a sandbox account in the [developer portal](https://developer.bunq.com/).\n1. Log in to the sandbox app using the sandbox user credentials.\n\nℹ️ *You will be asked to verify your phone number when you open the app for the first time. Sandbox does not send actual SMS messages. Enter any valid phone number and use the default verification code `992266`*. \n\nIf you couldn't generate a sandbox account in the developer portal, use Tinker:\n1. Install [Tinker](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/quickstart/tinker).\n1. Run `tinker/user-overview` to create a sandbox account. The output of the command will include the login credentials for the sandbox account.\n\n⚠️ **NOTE:** It is **not** possible to create accounts using the regular signup in the app, bunq is not reviewing Sandbox applications.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-moving-to-production\">Moving to Production</span>\n\nHave you tested your bunq integration to the fullest and are you now ready to introduce it to the world? Then the time has come to move it to a production environment!\n\nTo get started you'll need some fresh API keys for the production environment, which you can create via your bunq app. You can create these under \"Profile\" by tapping the \"Security\" menu. We do, however, highly recommend using a standard API Key instead of a Wildcard API Key. The former is significantly safer and it protects you from intrusions and possible attacks.\n\nThere's only a few things to do before your beautiful bunq creation can be moved to production. You're going to have to change your API Key and redo the sequence of calls to open a session.\n\nThe bunq Public API production environment is hosted at `https://api.bunq.com`.\n\nDo you have any questions or remarks about the process, or do you simply want to show off with your awesome creations? Don't hesitate to drop us a line on [together.bunq.com](https://together.bunq.com).\n\nPlease be aware that if you will gain access to account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, you  maybrequire a PSD2 permit.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-quickstart-opening-a-session\">Quickstart: Opening a Session</span>\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-goal\">Goal</span>\n\nSo, you want to start using the bunq API, awesome! To do this, you have to open a session in which you will be making those calls.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-getting-an-api-key\">Getting an API key</span>\n\nTo connect to the API, you have to make sure you have received an API key. \n\n**For production:**\n1. create an app in the [developer portal](http://developer.bunq.com/), or\n1. generate it in the bunq app *(Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys)*.\n\n**For sandbox**\nYou can use one of the following ways:\n- create a sandbox user in the [developer portal](http://developer.bunq.com/);\n- generate an API key in the [sandbox app](#android-emulator) *(Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys)*;\n- get an API key from [Tinker](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/quickstart/tinker);\n- run a cURL request: `curl https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/sandbox-user-person -X POST --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" --header \"Cache-Control: none\" --header \"User-Agent: curl-request\" --header \"X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id: $(date)randomId\" --header \"X-Bunq-Language: nl_NL\" --header \"X-Bunq-Region: nl_NL\" --header \"X-Bunq-Geolocation: 0 0 0 0 000\"`. Use `sandbox-user-company` to generate a business user.\n\nNote that production API key is only usable on production and sandbox key is only usable on sandbox. Sandbox key has a `sandbox_` prefix while production key does not have any noticeable prefixes.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-call-sequence\">Call sequence</span>\n\nThe calls you need to perform to set up a session from scratch are the following:\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-call-sequence-post-installation\">1. POST installation</span>\n\nEach call needs to be signed with your own private key. An Installation is used to tell the server about the public key of your key pair. The server uses this key to verify your subsequent calls.\n\nStart by generating a 2048-bit RSA key pair. You can find examples by looking at the source code of the sdk's located at github.\n\n#### Headers\n\nOn the headers page you can find out about the mandatory headers. Take care that if you are in the sandbox environment, you set an `Authorization` header. Specific to the `POST /installation` call, you shouldn't use the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` or the `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` headers.\n\n#### Body\n\nPost your public key to the Installation endpoint (use `\\n` for newlines in your public key).\n\n#### Response\n\nSave the Installation token and the bunq API's public key from the response. This token is used in the `Authentication` header to register a `DeviceServer` and to start a `SessionServer`. The bunq API's public key should be used to verify future responses received from the bunq API.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-call-sequence-post-device-server\">2. POST device-server</span>\n\nFurther calls made to the server need to come from a registered device. `POST /device-server` registers your current device and the IP address(es) it uses to connect to the bunq API.\n\n#### Headers\n\nUse the token you received from `POST /installation` in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header. Make sure you sign your call, passing the call signature in `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` header.\n\n#### Body\n\nFor the secret, use the API key you received. If you want to create another API key, you can do so in the bunq sandbox app (or production app for the production environment). Login, go to Profile > Security and tap 'API keys'. The freshly created API key can be assigned to one or multiple IP addresses using `POST device-server` within 4 hours before becoming invalid. As soon as you start using your API key, it will remain valid until the next sandbox reset.   For the secret, use the API key you received.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-call-sequence-post-session-server\">3. POST session-server</span>\n\nTo make any calls besides `installation` and `device-server`, you need to open a session.\n\n#### Headers\n\nUse the token you received from `POST /installation` in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header. Make sure you sign your call, passing the call signature in `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` header.\n\n#### Body\n\nFor the secret, use the API key you received.\n\n#### Response\n\nThe token received in the response to `POST /session-server` should be used to authenticate your calls in this session. Pass this session's token in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header on every call you make in this session.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request\">Quickstart: Payment Request</span>\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request-goal\">Goal</span>\n\nYou want to offer bunq payments on a website or in an application.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request-scenario\">Scenario</span>\n\nIn this use case the consumer and the merchant both have a bunq account. The consumer wants to pay with bunq and enters their alias in the bunq payment field at checkout. The merchant sends the request for payment to the consumer when the consumer presses enter. The consumer agrees to the request in the bunq mobile app and the merchant has immediate confirmation of the payment. Please be aware that if you will gain access to account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, you require a PSD2 permit.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request-before-you-start\">Before you start</span>\n\nMake sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence\">Call Sequence</span>\n\nThe consumer is at checkout and selects the bunq payment method. This would be a logical time to open a session on the bunq server.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence-list-monetary-account\">1. LIST monetary-account</span>\n\nWhen a request for payment is accepted, the money will be deposited on the bank account the request for payment is connected to. Let’s start by finding all your available bank accounts. Pick one of them to make the request for payment with and save its `id`.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence-post-monetary-account-attachment\">2. POST monetary-account attachment (optional)</span>\n\nOptionally, you can attach an image to the request for payment.\n\n#### Headers\nMake sure you set the `Content-Type` header to match the MIME type of the image. It’s also required you pass a description of the image via the `X-Bunq-Attachment-Description` header.\n\n#### Body\nThe payload of this request is the binary representation of the image file. Do not use any JSON formatting.\n\n#### Response\nSave the `id` of the posted attachment. You’ll need it to attach it to the request for payment.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence-post-request-inquiry\">3. POST request-inquiry</span>\n\nNext, create a request inquiry. A request inquiry is the request for payment that your customer can respond to by accepting or rejecting it.\n\n#### Body\n\nPass the customer’s email address, phone number or IBAN in the `counterparty_alias`. Make sure you set the correct `type` for the alias, depending on what you pass. When providing an IBAN, a name of the `counterparty_alias` is required. You can provide the `id` of the created attachment.\n\n#### Response\n\nYou will receive the `id` of the created request inquiry in the response. Save this `id`. You will need it to check if the customer has responded to the request yet.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence-get-request-inquiry\">4. GET request-inquiry</span>\n\nAfter you’ve sent the request for payment, its status can be checked.\n\n#### Response\n\nWhen the `status` is `ACCEPTED`, the customer has accepted and paid the request, and you will have received the money on the connected monetary account. If the `status` is `REJECTED`, the customer did not accept the request.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment\">Quickstart: Create a Tab payment</span>\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-goal\">Goal</span>\n\nYou will create a tab that can be paid once by a single user, a so called TagUsageSingle, and explore three different ways to make the Tab visible to your customers:\n\n- QR code from the CashRegister\n- QR code from the Tab.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-before-you-start\">Before you start</span>\n\nMake sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header.\n\n## <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence\">Call sequence</span>\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-attachment-public\">1. POST attachment-public</span>\n\nStart by creating an attachment that will be used for the avatar for the cash register.\n\n#### Header\n\nMake sure you set the `Content-Type` header to match the MIME type of the image. It is also required you pass a description of the image via the `X-Bunq-Attachment-Description` header.\n\n#### Body\n\nThe payload of this request is the binary representation of the image file. Do not use any JSON formatting.\n\n#### Response\n\nSave the `uuid` of the posted attachment. You'll need it to create the avatar in the next step.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-avatar\">2. POST avatar</span>\n\nMake an avatar using the public attachment you've just created.\n\n#### Body\n\nThe payload of this request is the `uuid` of the attachment public.\n\n#### Response\n\nIn response, you’ll receive the UUID of the avatar created using the attachment. Save this UUID. You’ll use it as the avatar for the cash register you're about to create.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-list-monetary-account\">3. LIST monetary-account</span>\n\nGet a listing of all available monetary accounts. Choose one, and save the id of the monetary account you want your cash register to be connected to. Each paid tab for the cash register will transfer the money to this account.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-cash-register\">4a. POST cash-register</span>\n\nCreate a cash register. Use the `id` of the monetary account you want to connect the cash register to in the URL of the request.\n\n#### Body\n\nIn the body provide the `uuid` of the avatar you created for this cash register. Also make sure to provide a unique name for your cash register. Set the status to `PENDING_APPROVAL`.\n\n#### Response\n\nThe response contains the `id` of the cash register you created. Save this `id`. You will need it to create subsequent tabs and tab items.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-wait-for-approval\">4b. Wait for approval</span>\n\nOn the production environment, a bunq admin will review and approve your cash register. In the sandbox environment, your cash register will be automatically approved.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-tab-usage-single\">5. POST tab-usage-single</span>\n\nCreate a new tab that is connected to your cash register. Use the id of the cash register you want to connect this tab to in the URL of your request.\n\n#### Body\n\nGive the tab a name in `merchant_reference`. Create the tab with status `OPEN`, and give the tab a starting amount. You can update this amount later.\n\n#### Response\n\nThe response contains the uuid of the tab you created.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-tab-item\">6. POST tab-item (optional)</span>\n\nYou can add items to a tab. For instance, if a customer will be paying for multiple products via this tab, you can decide to add an item for each of these. Adding items to a tab is optional, and adding them will not change the total amount of the tab itself. However, if you've added any tab items the sum of the amounts of these items must be equal to the `total_amount` of the tab when you change its status to `WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT`.\n\n### <span id=\"topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-put-tab-usage-single\">7. PUT tab-usage-single</span>\n\nUpdate the status of the tab to `WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT` if you want the costumer to pay the tab, and you're done adding any tab items. You can use this request to make the tab visible for your costumers.\n\n#### Visibility\n\nTo decide how you are going to make your tab visible, pass a visibility object in the payload.\n\nSetting `cash_register_qr_code` to true will connect this tab to the QR code from the cash register. If this cash register does not have a QR code yet, one will be created. Only one Tab can be connected to the cash register’s QR code at any given time.\n\nSetting `tab_qr_code` to true will create a QR code specifically for this tab. This QR code can not be linked to anything else.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-quickstart-transwerwise-payment\">Quickstart: Create a TransferWise payment</span>\n\n## Goal\n\nYou want to send a payment in currency other than euro outside the SEPA zone.\n\n## Before you start\n\nMake sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header.\n\nℹ️ *bunq relies on TransferWise for international, so you need to create a TransferWise account linked to a bunq account to be able to create international transfers. You can do it either from the bunq app or using our API as described below.*\n\n## Get the up-to-date exchange rate (optional)\n\nYou might want to check the latest currency exchange rate before making a transfer. Here’s how you can do it using the bunq API:\n1. Check the list of supported currencies via `GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-currency`. Copy the needed currency code.\n2. Create a temporary quote for the currency of your choice via `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote-temporary`.\n\nℹ️ *A quote is the exchange rate at the exact timestamp. Temporary quotes carry solely informative value and cannot be used for creating a transfer.*\n\n3. Read the temporary quote via `GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote-temporary/{transferwise-quote-temporaryID}`.\n\n## Create a TransferWise account\n\nYou need a TransferWise account linked to your bunq account to make TransferWise payments via the bunq API. Create one via `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-user`, and save its ID. \n\nℹ️ *You cannot use an existing TransferWise account.*\n\n## Create a quote\n\n1. Create a quote via POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote and save its ID. \n\nℹ️ *Use amount_target to indicate the sum the recipient must get. Amount_source, on the other hand, will indicate the sum you want to send, but it will not necessarily be the final sum the recipient gets.*\n\nℹ️ *Quotes are valid for 30 minutes so if you do not manage to create a transfer within this time, you will need to create another quote.*\n\n2. Get the exchange rate by reading the quote via GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/(transferwise-quoteID).\n\n## Create a recipient\n\nIf you have sent money via the TransferWise account linked to your bunq account, you can reuse the recipients. You can list their IDs via `GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient`.\n\nTo create a new, previously unused recipient, follow these steps:\n1. Retrieve the fields required for creating the recipient as the requirements vary for the type of recipient in each country. Iterate sending the following request pair till there are no more required fields:\n- `GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement`\n- `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement`\n2. Create a recipient account using the final request body from the previous step with `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement`\n\n## Create a transfer\n\nFinally, having both the quote ID and the recipient ID, you can create a transfer. 🎉\n\n1. Check if there are any additional transfer requirements via `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-transfer-requirement`.\n2. Create a transfer via `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-transfer`. You need to specify the ID of the monetary account from which you want the payment to be made.\n\n# <span id=\"topic-quickstart-attachments\">Quickstart: Downloading attachments</span>\n\n## Goal\nExport receipts and invoices attached to payments to your application.\n\n## The scenario you want to achieve\n0. The bunq user has accepted the authorization request and your application can read the bunq user’s account information.\n1. Your application imports all the transactions and attachments.\n2. The bunq user sees the transactions matched with the receipts and invoices in your application.\n\n## Before you start\n* Make sure that you have opened a session\n* Make sure you pass the session Token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header in all the following requests of the session.\n\n## Call sequence\n1. List the payments of the user via GET /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/payment.\n2. Check if the payments have attachments via GET /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/payment/{paymentID}/note-attachment. Save the attachment IDs.\n3.

For example:\n\n`/subaccounts?q=field:value,field2:value`\n\n## Order\n\nTo perform a sort, add `order_by` as a query parameter. For example:\n\n`/subaccounts?order_by=field:desc/asc`\n\n## AND / OR\n\nBy default, it will search using the `AND` operator. This can be set using `operator` as a query parameter. For example:\n\n`/subaccounts?q=field:value&operator=OR`\n\n**Options:**\n\n- `AN` - returns results matching **all** query fields specified\n\n- `OR` - returns results matching **any** query fields specified\n\n## Example\n\n`/subaccounts?q=first_name:john,last_name:smith&order_by=subaccount_id:asc&operator=AND`\n\n# CORS\n\nWhen creating your API app, specify the JavaScript (CORS) origins you'll be using. We use these origins to return the headers needed for CORS.\n\n# Date and Time\n\nAll date/timestamps will be returned in Unix time (also known as POSIX time or erroneously as Epoch time) with no leap seconds.\n\nFor example: `1435255816`\n\n```\n(ISO 8601: 2015-06-25T18:10:16Z)\n```\n\nMore information: [Wikipedia: Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).\n\nThere is ony one Unix time and it is created by using the UTC/GMT time zone. This means you might have convert time zones to calculate timestamps. Most programming language have libraries to help you converting time zones.\n\n**The current Unix time can be found here:** [Epoch Converter](http://www.epochconverter.com)\n\n# Testing\n\n## Test Credentials\n\nThese API credentials can be used to test specific scenarios.\n\n**Note:** you will need to create a free account to test other scenarios.

    "description": "**Last Modified**: Wed Jan  4 12:47:29 UTC 2023\n\n\nAll endpoints are only accessible via HTTPS.\n\n* All API endpoints are located at `https://platform.climate.com` (e.g.\n`https://platform.climate.com/v4/fields`).\n\n* The authorization token endpoint is located at\n`https://api.climate.com/api/oauth/token`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n`X-Http-Request-Id` response header will be returned on every call,\nsuccessful or not. If you experience an issue with our api and need\nto contact technical support, please supply the value of the `X-Http-Request-Id`\nheader along with an approximate time of when the request was made.\n\n## Request Limits\n\nWhen you’re onboarded to Climate’s API platform, your `x-api-key` is assigned a custom usage plan. Usage plans are unique to each partner and have the following key attributes: \n\n1. Throttling information\n    * burstLimit: Maximum rate limit over a period ranging from 1 second to a few seconds\n    * rateLimit: A steady-state rate limit\n\n2. Quota information\n    * Limit: The maximum number of requests that can be made in a given month\n\nWhen the request rate threshold is exceeded, a `429` response code is returned. Optionally, the [`Retry-After`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.37) header may be returned: \n\nFollowing are examples of rate limit errors:\n\n1. Rate limit exceeded:\n\n<br>HTTP/1.1 429 \n<br>Content-Type: application/json\n<br>Content-Length: 32\n\n   {\"message\":\"Too Many Requests\"}\n\n2. Quota exhausted:\n<br>HTTP/1.1 429 \n<br>Content-Type: application/json\n<br>Content-Length: 29\n\n    {\"message\":\"Limit Exceeded\"}\n\n## Pagination\n\nPagination is performed via headers. Any request which returns a `\"results\"`\narray may be paginated. The following figure shows how query results are laid out with\nX-Limit=4 and no filter applied.\n\n<img style=\"width:70%;height:auto;\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/climate-com/images/svg_upload_tests/paging.png\">\n\n* If there are no results, a response code of `304` will be returned.\n\n* If the response is the last set of results, a response code of `200` or\n`206` will be returned.\n\n* If there are more results, a response code of `206` will be returned.\n\n* If `X-Next-Token` is provided in the request headers but the token has\nexpired, a response code of `409` will be returned. This is only applicable\nfor some endpoints; see specific endpoint documentation below.\n\n#### X-Limit\n\nThe page size can be controlled with the `X-Limit` header. Valid values are\n`1-100` and defaults to `100`.\n\n#### X-Next-Token\n\nIf the results are paginated, a response header of `X-Next-Token` will be\nreturned. Use the associated value in the subsequent request (via the `X-Next-Token`\nrequest header) to retrieve the next page. The following sequence diagram shows how to\nuse `X-Next-Token` to fetch all the records.\n\n<img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/climate-com/images/svg_upload_tests/x-next-token.svg\">\n\n\n## Chunked Uploads\n\nUploads larger than `5MiB` (`5242880 bytes`) must be done in `5MiB` chunks\n(with the exception of the final chunk). Each chunk request MUST contain a\n`Content-Range` header specifying the portion of the upload, and a `Content-Type`\nheader specifying binary content type (`application/octet-stream`). Range\nuploads must be contiguous. The maximum upload size is capped at `500MiB` (`524288000 bytes`).\n\n## Chunked Downloads\n\nDownloads larger than `5MiB` (`5242880 bytes`) must be done in `1-5MiB`\nchunks (with the exception of the final chunk, which may be less than `1MiB`).\nEach chunk request MUST contain a `Range` header specifying the requested portion of the download,\nand an `Accept` header specifying binary and json content types  (`application/octet-stream,application/json`)\nor all content types (`*/*`).\n\n## Drivers\n\nIf you need drivers to process agronomic data, download the ADAPT plugin below. We only support the plugin in the Windows environment, minimum is Windows 7 SP1.\n\nFor asPlanted, asHarvested and asApplied data:\n* [ADAPT Plugin](https://dev.fieldview.com/drivers/ClimateADAPTPlugin_latest.exe)\n<br>Release notes can be found [here](https://dev.fieldview.com/drivers/adapt-release-notes.txt).\n<br>Download and use of the ADAPT plugin means that you agree to the EULA for use of the ADAPT plugin. \n<br>Please review the [EULA](https://dev.fieldview.com/EULA/ADAPT%20Plugin%20EULA-06-19.pdf) (last updated on June 6th, 2019) before download and use of the ADAPT plugin.\n<br>For more information, please refer to:\n  * [ADAPT Resources](https://adaptframework.org/)\n  * [ADAPT Overview](https://aggateway.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADM/overview)\n  * [ADAPT FAQ](https://aggateway.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADM/pages/165942474/ADAPT+Frequently-Asked+Questions+FAQ)\n  * [ADAPT Videos](https://adaptframework.org/adapt-videos/)\n\n## Sample Test Data\n\nSample agronomic data:\n* [asPlanted and asHarvested data](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/Planting_Harvesting_data_04_18_2018_21_46_18.zip)\n* [asApplied data set 1](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/as-applied-data1.zip)\n* [asApplied data set 2](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/as-applied-data2.zip)\n<br>To upload the sample data to your account, please follow the instructions in this [link](https://support.climate.com/kt#/kA02A000000AaxzSAC/en_US).\n\nSample soil data:\n* [Sample soil data](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-soil-data/soil-sample.xml)\n---\n",

    "title": "Public Api",
    "description": "# Introduction\n\nThis API allows resellers to manage their resources in a simple, programmatic way using HTTP requests.\n\n# Conventions\n\n## Requests\n\nThe API supports different methods depending on the required action.\n\n| Method\t| Description\n| ---\t\t| ---\n| GET\t\t| Retrieve resources in a collection or get a single resource.<br/>Getters will never have any effect on the queried resources.\n| POST\t\t| Create a new resource in a collection.\n| PUT\t\t| Update an existing resource with its new representation.\n| DELETE\t| Delete an existing resource.\n\n## HTTP status codes\n\nThe API will reply with different HTTP statuscodes:\n\n| StatusCode\t\t\t\t| Description\n| ---\t\t\t\t\t\t| ---\n| 200 OK\t\t\t\t\t| The requests was processed and you receive data as a result.\n| 201 CREATED\t\t\t\t| The resource has been created. Either the Location header contains a link to the created resource, or links are being returned in the response body. The applied method will be indicated in the documentation.\n| 202 ACCEPTED\t\t\t\t| The request has been validated and accepted. Because we need to do some background processing prior to returning the result, we cannot send back a useful representation.\n| 204 NOCONTENT\t\t\t\t| The request has been processed, but no details can be returned.\n| 400 BADREQUEST\t\t\t| Your request is malformed.\n| 401 UNAUTHORIZED\t\t\t| You are not authorized. Follow the instructions in the Authorization documentation.\n| 403 FORBIDDEN\t\t\t\t| Access to the resource or operation is not allowed.\n| 404 NOTFOUND\t\t\t\t| The resource cannot be found.\n| 410 GONE                  | The resource is permanently no longer available.\n| 429 TOOMANYREQUESTS\t\t| The ratelimit has been exceeded. Please refer to the documentation on rate limiting for more details.\n| 500 INTERNALSERVERERROR\t| An error occurred during the processing of the request. The error is unexpected and most likely due to a bug in the api.\n\nIn the event of a problem, the body of the response will usually contain an errorcode and errormessage.\nIn rare cases additional details about the error are reported.\n\nErrorcodes 400-499 are considered to be client errors and indicate that there was an issue with the request.\nWe will not take any action besides monitoring. \n\nErrorcodes 500-599 are considered to be server errors. The errors are monitored AND action will be taken to resolve the error.\n\n## Formatting\n\nSnake casing is applied on resources and query parameters.\nThe API is strictly returning JSON. No other formats are supported.\n\nDatetimes are returned in ISO-8601 format.\n\n## Pagination\n\nPagination is on by default on collections and is controlled by specifying *skip* and *take* parameters.  \n**Skip** indicates the number of results to skip and where to start the new take.  \n**Take** indicates the number of records to return. The returned number of items can be smaller than the requested take.\n\nPaged results will have headers with useful information regarding the paging.\n\n| Header\t\t\t\t| Description\n| ---\t\t\t\t\t| ---\n| X-Paging-Skipped\t\t| The number of results that have been skipped.\n| X-Paging-Take\t\t\t| The number of items in the current take. The number might differ from the requested take. It represents the actual number of items returned in the response.\n| X-Paging-TotalResults | The total number of results regardless of paging.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nThe number of requests per interval is limited. Detailed information on the rate limiting can be found in specific headers which will be sent on each request.\n\n| Header\t\t\t\t| Description\n| ---\t\t\t\t\t| ---\n| X-RateLimit-Limit\t\t| The number of requests that can be made in a specific time interval.\n| X-RateLimit-Usage\t\t| The number of requests already made in the current time interval.\n| X-RateLimit-Remaining\t| The number of requests remaining until the reset.\n| X-RateLimit-Reset\t\t| The number of seconds until the reset.<br />After the reset you are allowed to make as many requests as specified by the X-RateLimit-Limit header.\n| Retry-After\t\t\t| The number of seconds you have to wait until you can make new requests.<br />This header is only present when the rate limit has been reached. It is identical to X-RateLimit-Reset.\n\nWhen the ratelimit has been reached, all requests will return with a HTTP statuscode 429 and ReasonPhrase '*Too many requests, retry later.*'.\n\n# Authentication\n\nThe Api uses HMAC authentication.  \nHash-based message authentication code (HMAC) is a mechanism for calculating a message authentication code involving a hash function in combination with a secret key.  \nBoth the integrity and the authenticity of the message are verified this way.\n\n## Steps to generate the HMAC\n\n1. Get your api key and secret from your controlpanel.  \nIt is absolutely vital that the secret is never exposed. Once the secret is out, anyone would be able to generate hmacs to impersonate you.  \nIn case your secret is compromised, you can generate a new api key and secret on your controlpanel.\n2. Construct the input value for generating the hmac.  \nConcatenate:apikey, request method, path and querystring information, unix timestamp, nonce and content.\n\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| Description\n| ---\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| ---\n| apikey\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| The key that is linked to your user.\n| request method\t\t\t\t\t\t| lowercased (eg: get, post, delete,...)\n| path and querystring information\t\t| urlencoding of the lowercased relative path and querystring.<br />The path **MUST start with the api version (/v2)**.<br />The hexadecimal codes (percent encoding) MUST be uppercased.\n| unix timestamp\t\t\t\t\t\t| the unix timestamp in **seconds**.\n| nonce\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| a\tunique string for each request. It should be a random string, not related to the request. The nonce (in combination with the unix timestamp) protects you from replay attacks in case anyone was able to intercept a request.\n| content\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| When the request body is not empty, this should be the Base64 encoded Md5 hash of the request body.<br />An empty body should not be encoded.\n\n3. Hash the concatenated string using your api secret and the SHA-256 algorithm.\n4. Base64 encode the result of the hash function. This is the hmac signature you will need to send an authorized request.\n\n## Sending an authorized request\n\nAn authorized request can be made by sending the generated HMAC in the authorization header.  \nA correct authorizationheader uses the hmac authorization scheme and a correctly formatted authorization parameter.\n\nCreate the authorization parameter by concatenating:\n  * apikey\n  * colon ':'\n  * generated HMAC signature (see above)\n  * colon ':'\n  * nonce (the one used to generate the signature)\n  * colon ':'\n  * unix timestamp (the one used to generate the signature)\n\nA sample (illustrated):\n\n* The first line is the string you create to feed to the hashing algorithm.\n* The second line is the authorization header that should be sent in the request.\n\n![hmac authorization header illustrated](/v2/images/authentication_illustration.jpg \"authorization header illustrated\")\n\n## IP whitelisting\n\nAccess is by default restricted for all IP addresses. You need to explicitly whitelist an IP or an IP range in your controlpanel.\n\n# Versioning\n\nBecause of breaking contract changes compared to v1, we released v2 of the API.  \nV1 will still be available, but you are strongly encouraged to migrate to the latest version.  \nNew features will only be available on v2.\n\n# Policy\n\n### Fair use policy\n\nPlease respect the rate limits and do not use the api for any purposes of abuse.  \nAll requests are being monitored and logged.  \nIntentional abuse might result in api key revocation.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API attempts to return appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.  \nWhen the status code indicates failure, the API will also provide an error message in most cases.\n\nAn error message contains a machine-parseable error code accompanied by a descriptive error text.  \nThe text for an error message might change over time, but codes will stay the same.\n\n[An overview of error codes can be found here](/v2/documentation/errorcodes).\n\n# Change log\n\n[An overview of new changes can be found here](/v2/documentation/changelog).\n\n# Provisioning information\n\n## Terminology\n\n| Term\t\t\t| Definition\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| ---\t\t\t| ---\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Servicepack\t| Defines a set of assets that belong together. An example is a hosting package which offers Linux hosting, a domain name, a couple of mailboxes and databases.<br/>It also limits the size of individual assets within the same account. |\n| Account\t\t| Represents an instance of the servicepack. It contains one or more assets. The number and size of assets is defined by the servicepack. |\n| Asset\t\t\t| A manageable service. For example: a mysql database, a linux hosting, a mailbox,...<br/>Some assets are created at the moment when the account is created. Other assets can be created afterwards.\n\t\n## Common provisioning scenario\n\n**Provisioning of an account with Linux hosting with one MySql database**\n\n*Without a pre-existing account:*\n\n1. Create a new account.<br/>Perform a POST on the accounts route and provide the desired servicepack id and identifier (domain name).\n2. Read the Location header from the response and perform a GET of the provided resource (a provisioning job).\n3. When the response returns 200(OK), you should repeat the GET operation after a certain interval (Repeat this step).<br/>\nWhen the response returns 201(Created), you should read the response body. This will contain links to the created resources.<br/>\nThis will usually hold only one link, but to be futureproof, this has been designed to return a collection.\n4. The created resource will point to an account. You now know the account's Id and can continue with the provisioning of a MySql database on this account.\n5. Perform a POST on the mysqldatabases route and provide the account id along with other requested information.\n6. Read the Location header from the response and perform a GET of the provided resource (a provisioning job).\n7. When the response returns 200(OK), you should repeat the GET operation after a certain interval (Repeat this step).<br/>\nWhen the response returns 201(Created), you should read the response body. This will contain links to the created resources.<br/>\nThis will usually hold only one link, but to be futureproof, this has been designed to return a collection.\n8. The created resource will point to a MySql database resource.\n\n## SSL certificate requests\n\n**Requesting an SSL certificate causes the purchase of a paying product.**\n\n1. A certificate is created by adding an ssl certificate request.\n2. Upon statuscode 201 you should query for certificate completion on the resource provided in the location response header.\n3. The resource request can respond with different statuscodes:\n<ul>\n    <li>200: the certificate request is ongoing.<br/>\nCheck the validations collection for validation values that are not auto_validated. Those should be set by you system.<br/>\nCall verify domain validations once all validation values are in place. It might take some time for verification to take place. It is not necessary to call this method more than once.</li>\n    <li>303: the certificate request is complete; there is no more certificate request resource available. Check the location header value to retrieve the representation of the resulting ssl certificate.</li>\n    <li>410: the certificate request does not exist anymore, there is no certificate created as a result of the request.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "# Overview\n\nThe ContentGroove Developer API enables you to add the power of ContentGroove's video AI to your own applications and workflows.\n\nWebhooks are a way for ContentGroove to send video information\nto your application, to update your system and/or trigger other business processes.\n\nYou can use Webhooks and the Developer API separately or together.\n\n# Getting Started with Webhooks\n\n- Sign up for an account at [app.contentgroove.com](https://app.contentgroove.com)\n- Read \"Using Webhooks\" on the [API Reference page](https://developers.contentgroove.com/api_reference)\n- Visit the [Webhooks page](https://app.contentgroove.com/webhook_subscriptions) and create a new webhook\n\n# Using Webhooks\n\nWebhooks, also known as callbacks, are a way for ContentGroove to notify your application as soon as possible after an event has occurred in ContentGroove.\nFor example after a media completes processing, ContentGroove can use a webhook to notify your application with information about the video: Suggested clips, transcription, and so on.\nYou can use the information sent to update your system and/or use the\nwebhook to trigger other business processes.\n\nThe webhook request is sent as an HTTP POST containing a payload of JSON-formatted data.\nFor the details of the payload format see the \"CALLBACKS\" sections below.\n\nWhen your application receives the webhook request, it must respond with\na 200 HTTP status code (success).\nIf a 200 HTTP status code is not returned,\nContentGroove will assume that the webhook was not delivered and\nwill retry a limited number of times, using an exponential backoff algorithm.\n\nContentGroove makes a best effort to attempt to send the webhook at\nleast once.\nApplications receiving webhooks must tolerate the\npossibility of a single webhook payload being sent more than once\n(idempotent behavior).\nApplications receiving webhooks should tolerate the possibility that\na webhook could not be delivered\n(for example your application was down when delivery was attempted).\n\n# Getting Started with the Developer API\n\n- Sign up for an account at [app.contentgroove.com](https://app.contentgroove.com)\n- Visit the [API Keys page](https://app.contentgroove.com/api_keys)\n  - Create a new API Key then copy and save the value.\n    > ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This API Key is intended only for use on the server side. Be sure never to use a server-side API Key in client-side (web, mobile, or otherwise) code. ⚠️\n- View all available endpoints, and try the API, on our [API Reference page](https://developers.contentgroove.com/api_reference)\n\n# Using the Developer API\n\n- Create a new media (video or audio) in ContentGroove\n  - If the video or audio is available from a URL, you can create a media by providing the `source_url` parameter. ContentGroove will fetch the video or audio from the URL if possible.\n  - Or, you can create a media from a video or audio file which you upload directly to ContentGroove (see File Uploading section below).\n- After the new media is created, at first it will be in a \"processing\" state.\n  Depending on the size and duration of the video or audio file, it will take some time for processing to complete.\n  - You can use ContentGroove Webhooks to be notified immediately when processing has completed. (Details coming soon.)\n  - You can also use the API to read the state of the media, to determine if the media has completed processing yet.\n- After the media has completed processing, you can access all of these details about the media:\n  - The media name and description\n  - The transcription of spoken words\n  - Topics and keywords which were discussed in the transcription\n  - Suggested video clips are automatically created\n- In addition to the automatically created video clips, you can create more video clips from the media\n\n# Response Codes\n\nThe following is a comprehensive list of the status codes you may receive while using the ContentGroove API:\n\n- 200 \"Ok\"\n  - The request was valid\n- 400 \"Bad Request\n  - This is returned when there was a problem parsing the JSON body of your request if you supplied the 'Content-Type': 'application/json' header, or if your request is missing the 'Content-Type' header altogether\n- 401 \"Unauthorized\"\n  - This is returned when you are attempting to perform an action on a resource that you are not authorized to do\n- 402 \"Payment Required\"\n  - This is returned when you are attempting to perform an action that would push your account above a usage limit. You can view your usage at: https://app.contentgroove.com/quota_usage\n- 404 \"Not Found\"\n  - This is returned when the resource you are trying to view does not exist\n- 429 \"Too Many Requests\"\n  - This is returned when you have performed too many requests within a given period of time\n- 500 \"Internal Server Error\"\n  - This is returned when your request was valid but there was a problem on our end\n\n# File Uploading\n\n- Step 1: Make a GET request to the direct uploads URL endpoint (/api/v1/direct_uploads) to receive an upload URL to upload the file to and an upload id.\n- Step 2: Make a PUT request with the file as the body to the upload URL received in step 1. The response will have a 200 status with no body if the upload is successful.\n  ```\n  curl -T /path/to/file upload_url\n  ```\n- Step 3: After uploading the file to the upload URL, make a POST request to the create medias endpoint (/api/v1/medias), with the upload id and optionally a name and description for the new media.\n  > At this time, file uploads are limited to 5gb per file.\n\n# Allowed media types\n\nVideo:\n\n- Supported: Most common video formats and codecs are supported.\n- Recommended: mp4\n\nAudio:\n\n- Supported: aac, mp3, flac, ogg, wav, and wma\n- Recommended: aac\n\n# Authentication\n\nYou can use the API Key to authenticate your API requests using any of these methods. (Replace abc123 with your actual API Key.)\n\n- Request header `Authorization: Bearer abc123`\n- Request header `X-API-KEY: abc123`\n- Query parameter `api_key=abc123`\n  > ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This API Key is intended only for use on the server side.

There are 3 authentication mechanisms:\n- HTTP Basic (Username + Password)\n- JWT Token\n- API-Key\n\nBy default you should have an account allowing you to bootstrap your tenant and create users and roles, using Basic Auth or after creating a Token  - see */auth* endpoints.\n\nIf you are missing credentials or permissions, please [contact us](https://contract.fit/contact-us).\n\n### Authorization\n\nThe security system is RBAC based: users must be granted scoped roles, allowing them to access resources.\nEach role grants a defined set of permissions, which can be restricted to a given inbox or document - see */roles* endpoints.\n\n## Upload and Processing\n\nBelow is a short description of common use cases of the API.\n\n### Simple Upload\n\nThe easiest and simplest way to get started is to use POST /documents : it will make a synchronous upload of your file and wait for the result.\n\nThis is a simplified version of POST /documents/{inbox_id} with less arguments and settings; it may not be suitable for real workload as it offers less capabilities.\n\n### Upload to Inbox\n\nThe favored endpoint to upload files is POST /documents/{inbox_id}: it is also highly recommended to make async call using sync=false.\n\n**Sync / Async**\n\nFor convenience uploads can be synchronous: it will make the request blocks until the document is processed.\n\nIt is however discouraged to rely on sync requests, as our service is designed to process documents asynchronously. You might run into timeouts and unprocessed document depending on factors such as server load and number of pending documents.\n\nAsynchronous calls will only schedule the processing and directly return the document ID without waiting: the document will be processed as soon as possible. You can then wait for the processed result using GET */documents/{document_id}*.\n\n### Reprocessing\n\nYou can reprocess a document using POST */documents/{document_id}/reprocess* : it will schedule an async processing of the document (note: it is not possible to make a sync reprocessing)\n",

In case of batch requests, the response\n    is an array of objects, each of which contains its own <b>status</b> and <b>data</b> fields.\n    For search queries the response contains an additional field <b>totalHits</b>, which is the \n    total number of items which match the search criteria.</p>\n\n<h2>Search query syntax</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Complex search queries can be used in all of the API search methods.\n    The query can be a simple string or it can be built using terms and operators described in Elasticsearch\n    <a href=\"http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax\">documentation</a>.\n    The usable field names are <strong>title</strong>, <strong>description</strong>, <strong>fullText</strong>, \n    <strong>authors</strong>, <strong>publisher</strong>, <strong>repositories.id</strong>, <strong>repositories.name</strong>, \n    <strong>doi</strong>, <strong>oai</strong>, <strong>identifiers</strong> (which is a list of article identifiers including OAI, URL, etc.), <strong>language.name</strong> \n    and <strong>year</strong>. Some example queries:\n</p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n    <li><p>title:psychology and language.name:English</p></li>\n    <li><p>repositories.id:86 AND year:2014</p></li>\n    <li><p>identifiers:\"oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164/3837\" OR identifiers:\"oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164/3843\"</p></li>\n    <li><p>doi:\"10.1186/1471-2458-6-309\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Retrieving the latest Articles</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n    You can retrieve the harvested items since specific dates using the following queries:\n</p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n    <li><p>repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:>2017-02-10</p></li>\n    <li><p>repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:>2017-03-01 AND repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:<2017-03-31</p></li>    \n</ul>\n\n<h2>Sort order</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For search queries, the results are ordered by relevance score. For batch \n    requests, the results are retrieved in the order of the requests.</p>\n\n<h2>Parameters</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The API methods allow different parameters to be passed. Additionally, there is an API key parameter which is common to all API methods. For all API methods \n    the API key can be provided either as a query parameter or in the request header. If the API key \n    is not provided, the API will return HTTP 401 error. You can register for an API key <a href=\"/services#api\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>API methods</h2>",

    "title": "PeerTube",
    "description": "The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite\nHTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube. The spec API is fully compatible with\n[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/wiki/API-client-generator-HOWTO)\nwhich generates a client SDK in the language of your choice - we generate some client SDKs automatically:\n\n- [Python](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/python)\n- [Go](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/go)\n- [Kotlin](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/kotlin)\n\nSee the [REST API quick start](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-getting-started) for a few\nexamples of using the PeerTube API.\n\n# Authentication\n\nWhen you sign up for an account on a PeerTube instance, you are given the possibility\nto generate sessions on it, and authenticate there using an access token. Only __one\naccess token can currently be used at a time__.\n\n## Roles\n\nAccounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on\nPeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/managing-users#roles) for a detail of their permissions.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure\nof the API call, completed by a [RFC7807-compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) response body.\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 404 Not Found\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Video not found\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 404,\n  \"title\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWe provide error `type` values for [a growing number of cases](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/shared/models/server/server-error-code.enum.ts),\nbut it is still optional. Types are used to disambiguate errors that bear the same status code\nand are non-obvious:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Cannot get this video regarding follow constraints\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 403,\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\n  \"type\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-reference.html#section/Errors/does_not_respect_follow_constraints\"\n}\n```\n\nHere a 403 error could otherwise mean that the video is private or blocklisted.\n\n### Validation errors\n\nEach parameter is evaluated on its own against a set of rules before the route validator\nproceeds with potential testing involving parameter combinations. Errors coming from validation\nerrors appear earlier and benefit from a more detailed error description:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Incorrect request parameters: id\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"instance\": \"/api/v1/videos/9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\",\n  \"invalid-params\": {\n    \"id\": {\n      \"location\": \"params\",\n      \"msg\": \"Invalid value\",\n      \"param\": \"id\",\n      \"value\": \"9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"status\": 400,\n  \"title\": \"Bad Request\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `id` is the name of the field concerned by the error, within the route definition.\n`invalid-params.<field>.location` can be either 'params', 'body', 'header', 'query' or 'cookies', and\n`invalid-params.<field>.value` reports the value that didn't pass validation whose `invalid-params.<field>.msg`\nis about.\n\n### Deprecated error fields\n\nSome fields could be included with previous versions. They are still included but their use is deprecated:\n- `error`: superseded by `detail`\n- `code`: superseded by `type` (which is now an URI)\n\n# Rate limits\n\nWe are rate-limiting all endpoints of PeerTube's API. Custom values can be set by administrators:\n\n| Endpoint (prefix: `/api/v1`) | Calls         | Time frame   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| `/*`                         | 50            | 10 seconds   |\n| `POST /users/token`          | 15            | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/register`       | 2<sup>*</sup> | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/ask-send-verify-email` | 3      | 5 minutes    |\n\nDepending on the endpoint, <sup>*</sup>failed requests are not taken into account. A service\nlimit is announced by a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.\n\nYou can get details about the current state of your rate limit by reading the\nfollowing headers:\n\n| Header                  | Description                                                |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Number of max requests allowed in the current time period  |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of remaining requests in the current time period    |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp  |\n| `Retry-After`           | Seconds to delay after the first `429` is received         |\n\n# CORS\n\nThis API features [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),\nallowing cross-domain communication from the browser for some routes:\n\n| Endpoint                    |\n|------------------------- ---|\n| `/api/*`                    |\n| `/download/*`               |\n| `/lazy-static/*`            |\n| `/.well-known/webfinger`    |\n\nIn addition, all routes serving ActivityPub are CORS-enabled for all origins.\n",

    "id": "digitalocean.com",
    "title": "DigitalOcean API",
    "description": "# Introduction\n\nThe DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the\nDigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests.\n\nAll of the functionality that you are familiar with in the DigitalOcean\ncontrol panel is also available through the API, allowing you to script the\ncomplex actions that your situation requires.\n\nThe API documentation will start with a general overview about the design\nand technology that has been implemented, followed by reference information\nabout specific endpoints.\n\n## Requests\n\nAny tool that is fluent in HTTP can communicate with the API simply by\nrequesting the correct URI. Requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol\nso that traffic is encrypted. The interface responds to different methods\ndepending on the action required.\n\n|Method|Usage|\n|--- |--- |\n|GET|For simple retrieval of information about your account, Droplets, or environment, you should use the GET method.  The information you request will be returned to you as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests.  Any request using the GET method is read-only and will not affect any of the objects you are querying.|\n|DELETE|To destroy a resource and remove it from your account and environment, the DELETE method should be used.  This will remove the specified object if it is found.  If it is not found, the operation will return a response indicating that the object was not found. This idempotency means that you do not have to check for a resource's availability prior to issuing a delete command, the final state will be the same regardless of its existence.|\n|PUT|To update the information about a resource in your account, the PUT method is available. Like the DELETE Method, the PUT method is idempotent.  It sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the current attributes of the object.|\n|PATCH|Some resources support partial modification. In these cases, the PATCH method is available. Unlike PUT which generally requires a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is is a set of instructions on how to modify a resource updating only specific attributes.|\n|POST|To create a new object, your request should specify the POST method. The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object.  When you wish to create a new object, send a POST request to the target endpoint.|\n|HEAD|Finally, to retrieve metadata information, you should use the HEAD method to get the headers.  This returns only the header of what would be returned with an associated GET request. Response headers contain some useful information about your API access and the results that are available for your request. For instance, the headers contain your current rate-limit value and the amount of time available until the limit resets. It also contains metrics about the total number of objects found, pagination information, and the total content length.|\n\n\n## HTTP Statuses\n\nAlong with the HTTP methods that the API responds to, it will also return\nstandard HTTP statuses, including error codes.\n\nIn the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code, while the\nbody of the response will usually contain additional information about the\nproblem that was encountered.\n\nIn general, if the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that\nthe request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.\n\nReturn codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue\nwith the request that was sent. Among other things, this could mean that you\ndid not authenticate correctly, that you are requesting an action that you\ndo not have authorization for, that the object you are requesting does not\nexist, or that your request is malformed.\n\nIf you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a\nserver-side problem. This means that we are having an issue on our end and\ncannot fulfill your request currently.\n\n400 and 500 level error responses will include a JSON object in their body,\nincluding the following attributes:\n\n|Name|Type|Description|\n|--- |--- |--- |\n|id|string|A short identifier corresponding to the HTTP status code returned. For example, the ID for a response returning a 404 status code would be \"not_found.\"|\n|message|string|A message providing additional information about the error, including details to help resolve it when possible.|\n|request_id|string|Optionally, some endpoints may include a request ID that should be provided when reporting bugs or opening support tickets to help identify the issue.|\n\n### Example Error Response\n\n```\n    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\n    {\n      \"id\":       \"forbidden\",\n      \"message\":  \"You do not have access for the attempted action.\"\n    }\n```\n\n## Responses\n\nWhen a request is successful, a response body will typically be sent back in\nthe form of a JSON object. An exception to this is when a DELETE request is\nprocessed, which will result in a successful HTTP 204 status and an empty\nresponse body.\n\nInside of this JSON object, the resource root that was the target of the\nrequest will be set as the key. This will be the singular form of the word\nif the request operated on a single object, and the plural form of the word\nif a collection was processed.\n\nFor example, if you send a GET request to `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID` you\nwill get back an object with a key called \"`droplet`\". However, if you send\nthe GET request to the general collection at `/v2/droplets`, you will get\nback an object with a key called \"`droplets`\".\n\nThe value of these keys will generally be a JSON object for a request on a\nsingle object and an array of objects for a request on a collection of\nobjects.\n\n### Response for a Single Object\n\n```\n    {\n        \"droplet\": {\n            \"name\": \"example.com\"\n            . . .\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Response for an Object Collection\n\n```\n    {\n        \"droplets\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"example.com\"\n                . . .\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"second.com\"\n                . . .\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n```\n\n## Meta\n\nIn addition to the main resource root, the response may also contain a\n`meta` object. This object contains information about the response itself.\n\nThe `meta` object contains a `total` key that is set to the total number of\nobjects returned by the request. This has implications on the `links` object\nand pagination.\n\nThe `meta` object will only be displayed when it has a value. Currently, the\n`meta` object will have a value when a request is made on a collection (like\n`droplets` or `domains`).\n\n\n### Sample Meta Object\n\n```\n    {\n        . . .\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"total\": 43\n        }\n        . . .\n    }\n```\n\n## Links & Pagination\n\nThe `links` object is returned as part of the response body when pagination\nis enabled. By default, 20 objects are returned per page. If the response\ncontains 20 objects or fewer, no `links` object will be returned. If the\nresponse contains more than 20 objects, the first 20 will be returned along\nwith the `links` object.\n\nYou can request a different pagination limit or force pagination by\nappending `?per_page=` to the request with the number of items you would\nlike per page. For instance, to show only two results per page, you could\nadd `?per_page=2` to the end of your query. The maximum number of results\nper page is 200.\n\nThe `links` object contains a `pages` object. The `pages` object, in turn,\ncontains keys indicating the relationship of additional pages. The values of\nthese are the URLs of the associated pages. The keys will be one of the\nfollowing:\n\n*   **first**: The URI of the first page of results.\n*   **prev**: The URI of the previous sequential page of results.\n*   **next**: The URI of the next sequential page of results.\n*   **last**: The URI of the last page of results.\n\nThe `pages` object will only include the links that make sense. So for the\nfirst page of results, no `first` or `prev` links will ever be set. This\nconvention holds true in other situations where a link would not make sense.\n\n### Sample Links Object\n\n```\n    {\n        . . .\n        \"links\": {\n            \"pages\": {\n                \"last\": \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2\",\n                \"next\": \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2\"\n            }\n        }\n        . . .\n    }\n```\n\n## Rate Limit\n\nRequests through the API are rate limited per OAuth token. Current rate limits:\n\n*   5,000 requests per hour\n*   250 requests per minute (5% of the hourly total)\n\nOnce you exceed either limit, you will be rate limited until the next cycle\nstarts. Space out any requests that you would otherwise issue in bursts for\nthe best results.\n\nThe rate limiting information is contained within the response headers of\neach request. The relevant headers are:\n\n*   **ratelimit-limit**: The number of requests that can be made per hour.\n*   **ratelimit-remaining**: The number of requests that remain before you hit your request limit. See the information below for how the request limits expire.\n*   **ratelimit-reset**: This represents the time when the oldest request will expire. The value is given in [Unix epoch time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). See below for more information about how request limits expire.\n\nAs long as the `ratelimit-remaining` count is above zero, you will be able\nto make additional requests.\n\nThe way that a request expires and is removed from the current limit count\nis important to understand. Rather than counting all of the requests for an\nhour and resetting the `ratelimit-remaining` value at the end of the hour,\neach request instead has its own timer.\n\nThis means that each request contributes toward the `ratelimit-remaining`\ncount for one complete hour after the request is made. When that request's\ntimer runs out, it is no longer counted towards the request limit.\n\nThis has implications on the meaning of the `ratelimit-reset` header as\nwell. Because the entire rate limit is not reset at one time, the value of\nthis header is set to the time when the _oldest_ request will expire.\n\nKeep this in mind if you see your `ratelimit-reset` value change, but not\nmove an entire hour into the future.\n\nIf the `ratelimit-remaining` reaches zero, subsequent requests will receive\na 429 error code until the request reset has been reached. You can see the\nformat of the response in the examples.\n\n**Note:** The following endpoints have special rate limit requirements that\nare independent of the limits defined above.\n\n*   Only 12 `POST` requests to the `/v2/floating_ips` endpoint to create Floating IPs can be made per 60 seconds.\n*   Only 10 `GET` requests to the `/v2/account/keys` endpoint to list SSH keys can be made per 60 seconds.\n*   Only 5 requests to any and all `v2/cdn/endpoints` can be made per 10 seconds. This includes `v2/cdn/endpoints`, \n    `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID`, and `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache`.\n*   Only 50 strings within the `files` json struct in the `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache` [payload](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#operation/cdn_purge_cache) \n    can be requested every 20 seconds.\n\n### Sample Rate Limit Headers\n\n```\n    . . .\n    ratelimit-limit: 1200\n    ratelimit-remaining: 1193\n    rateLimit-reset: 1402425459\n    . . .\n```\n\n### Sample Rate Exceeded Response\n\n```\n    429 Too Many Requests\n    {\n            id: \"too_many_requests\",\n            message: \"API Rate limit exceeded.\"\n    }\n```\n\n## Curl Examples\n\nThroughout this document, some example API requests will be given using the\n`curl` command. This will allow us to demonstrate the various endpoints in a\nsimple, textual format.\n  \n  These examples assume that you are using a Linux or macOS command line. To run\nthese commands on a Windows machine, you can either use cmd.exe, PowerShell, or WSL:\n\n* For cmd.exe, use the `set VAR=VALUE` [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1)\nto define environment variables, call them with `%VAR%`, then replace all backslashes (`\\`) in the examples with carets (`^`).\n\n* For PowerShell, use the `$Env:VAR = \"VALUE\"` [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.2)\nto define environment variables, call them with `$Env:VAR`, then replace `curl` with `curl.exe` and all backslashes (`\\`) in the examples with backticks (`` ` ``).\n\n* WSL is a compatibility layer that allows you to emulate a Linux terminal on a Windows machine.\nInstall WSL with our [community tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-microsoft-windows-10), \nthen follow this API documentation normally.\n\nThe names of account-specific references (like Droplet IDs, for instance)\nwill be represented by variables. For instance, a Droplet ID may be\nrepresented by a variable called `$DROPLET_ID`. You can set the associated\nvariables in your environment if you wish to use the examples without\nmodification.\n\nThe first variable that you should set to get started is your OAuth\nauthorization token. The next section will go over the details of this, but\nyou can set an environmental variable for it now.\n\nGenerate a token by going to the [Apps & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications)\nsection of the DigitalOcean control panel. Use an existing token if you have\nsaved one, or generate a new token with the \"Generate new token\" button.\nCopy the generated token and use it to set and export the TOKEN variable in\nyour environment as the example shows.\n\nYou may also wish to set some other variables now or as you go along. For\nexample, you may wish to set the `DROPLET_ID` variable to one of your\nDroplet IDs since this will be used frequently in the API.\n\nIf you are following along, make sure you use a Droplet ID that you control\nso that your commands will execute correctly.\n\nIf you need access to the headers of a response through `curl`, you can pass\nthe `-i` flag to display the header information along with the body. If you\nare only interested in the header, you can instead pass the `-I` flag, which\nwill exclude the response body entirely.\n\n\n### Set and Export your OAuth Token\n\n```\nexport DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_token_here\n```\n\n### Set and Export a Variable\n\n```\nexport DROPLET_ID=1111111\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\nThere are two different ways to pass parameters in a request with the API.\n\nWhen passing parameters to create or update an object, parameters should be\npassed as a JSON object containing the appropriate attribute names and\nvalues as key-value pairs. When you use this format, you should specify that\nyou are sending a JSON object in the header. This is done by setting the\n`Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This ensures that your request\nis interpreted correctly.\n\nWhen passing parameters to filter a response on GET requests, parameters can\nbe passed using standard query attributes. In this case, the parameters\nwould be embedded into the URI itself by appending a `?` to the end of the\nURI and then setting each attribute with an equal sign. Attributes can be\nseparated with a `&`. Tools like `curl` can create the appropriate URI when\ngiven parameters and values; this can also be done using the `-F` flag and\nthen passing the key and value as an argument. The argument should take the\nform of a quoted string with the attribute being set to a value with an\nequal sign.\n\n### Pass Parameters as a JSON Object\n\n```\n    curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN\" \\\n        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n        -d '{\"name\": \"example.com\", \"ip_address\": \"127.0.0.1\"}' \\\n        -X POST \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains\"\n```\n\n### Pass Filter Parameters as a Query String\n\n```\n     curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN\" \\\n         -X GET \\\n         \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?private=true\"\n```\n\n## Cross Origin Resource Sharing\n\nIn order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements\nCross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.\n\nCORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain\nthat the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects\nlike control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can\nsend requests to an outside domain.\n\nThe procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions\n(other than GET requests) begins by sending a \"preflight\" request. This sets\nthe `Origin` header and uses the `OPTIONS` method. The server will reply\nback with the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The\nclient then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed\nconstraints.\n\nThis process is usually done in the background by the browser, but you can\nuse curl to emulate this process using the example provided. The headers\nthat will be set to show the constraints are:\n\n*   **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: This is the domain that is sent by the client or browser as the origin of the request. It is set through an `Origin` header.\n*   **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: This specifies the allowed options for requests from that domain. This will generally be all available methods.\n*   **Access-Control-Expose-Headers**: This will contain the headers that will be available to requests from the origin domain.\n*   **Access-Control-Max-Age**: This is the length of time that the access is considered valid. After this expires, a new preflight should be sent.\n*   **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**: This will be set to `true`. It basically allows you to send your OAuth token for authentication.\n\nYou should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers,\nbecause the browser will typically do all of the work for you.\n",

    "description": "This page contains the documentation on how to use Discourse through API calls.\n\n> Note: For any endpoints not listed you can follow the\n[reverse engineer the Discourse API](https://meta.discourse.org/t/-/20576)\nguide to figure out how to use an API endpoint.\n\n### Request Content-Type\n\nThe Content-Type for POST and PUT requests can be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,\n`multipart/form-data`, or `application/json`.\n\n### Endpoint Names and Response Content-Type\n\nMost API endpoints provide the same content as their HTML counterparts. For example\nthe URL `/categories` serves a list of categories, the `/categories.json` API provides the\nsame information in JSON format.\n\nInstead of sending API requests to `/categories.json` you may also send them to `/categories`\nand add an `Accept: application/json` header to the request to get the JSON response.\nSending requests with the `Accept` header is necessary if you want to use URLs\nfor related endpoints returned by the API, such as pagination URLs.\nThese URLs are returned without the `.json` prefix so you need to add the header in\norder to get the correct response format.\n\n### Authentication\n\nSome endpoints do not require any authentication, pretty much anything else will\nrequire you to be authenticated.\n\nTo become authenticated you will need to create an API Key from the admin panel.\n\nOnce you have your API Key you can pass it in along with your API Username\nas an HTTP header like this:\n\n```\ncurl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin/users/list/active.json\" \\\n-H \"Api-Key: 714552c6148e1617aeab526d0606184b94a80ec048fc09894ff1a72b740c5f19\" \\\n-H \"Api-Username: system\"\n```\n\nand this is how POST requests will look:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/categories\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data;\" \\\n-H \"Api-Key: 714552c6148e1617aeab526d0606184b94a80ec048fc09894ff1a72b740c5f19\" \\\n-H \"Api-Username: system\" \\\n-F \"name=89853c20-4409-e91a-a8ea-f6cdff96aaaa\" \\\n-F \"color=49d9e9\" \\\n-F \"text_color=f0fcfd\"\n```\n\n### Boolean values\n\nIf an endpoint accepts a boolean be sure to specify it as a lowercase\n`true` or `false` value unless noted otherwise.\n",

    "title": "D&D 5e API",
    "description": "# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the dnd5eapi, the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition API!\nThis documentation should help you familiarize yourself with the resources\navailable and how to consume them with HTTP requests. Read through the getting\nstarted section before you dive in. Most of your problems should be solved\njust by reading through it.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nLet's make our first API request to the D&D 5th Edition API!\n\nOpen up a terminal and use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) or [httpie](http://httpie.org/)\nto make an API request for a resource. You can also scroll through the\ndefinitions below and send requests directly from the endpoint documentation!\n\nFor example, if you paste and run this `curl` command:\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/ability-scores/cha\" -H \"Accept: application/json\"\n```\n\nWe should see a result containing details about the Charisma ability score:\n```bash\n{\n  \"index\": \"cha\",\n  \"name\": \"CHA\",\n  \"full_name\": \"Charisma\",\n  \"desc\": [\n    \"Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It\n      includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent\n      a charming or commanding personality.\",\n    \"A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain\n      others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie,\n      or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception,\n      Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in\n      certain kinds of Charisma checks.\"\n  ],\n  \"skills\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Deception\",\n      \"index\": \"deception\",\n      \"url\": \"/api/skills/deception\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Intimidation\",\n      \"index\": \"intimidation\",\n      \"url\": \"/api/skills/intimidation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Performance\",\n      \"index\": \"performance\",\n      \"url\": \"/api/skills/performance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Persuasion\",\n      \"index\": \"persuasion\",\n      \"url\": \"/api/skills/persuasion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"url\": \"/api/ability-scores/cha\"\n}\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe dnd5eapi is a completely open API. No authentication is required to query\nand get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just\n`GET`-ing the data. If you find a mistake in the data, feel free to\n[message us](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7).\n\n## GraphQL\n\nThis API supports [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). The GraphQL URL for this API\nis `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/graphql`. Most of your questions regarding the GraphQL schema can be answered\nby querying the endpoint with the Apollo sandbox explorer.\n\n## Schemas\n\nDefinitions of all schemas will be accessible in a future update. Two of the most common schemas are described here.\n\n### `APIReference`\nRepresents a minimal representation of a resource. The detailed representation of the referenced resource can be retrieved by making a request to the referenced `URL`.\n```\nAPIReference {\n  index     string\n  name      string\n  url       string\n}\n```\n<hr>\n\n### `DC`\nRepresents a difficulty check.\n```\nDC {\n  dc_type       APIReference\n  dc_value      number\n  success_type  \"none\" | \"half\" | \"other\"\n}\n```\n<hr>\n\n### `Damage`\nRepresents damage.\n```\nDamage {\n  damage_type     APIReference\n  damage_dice     string\n}\n```\n<hr>\n\n### `Choice`\nRepresents a choice made by a player. Commonly seen related to decisions made during character creation or combat (e.g.: the description of the cleric class, under **Proficiencies**, states \"Skills: Choose two from\tHistory, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and\tReligion\" [[SRD p15]](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=15))\n```\nChoice {\n  desc      string\n  choose    number\n  type      string\n  from      OptionSet\n}\n```\n<hr>\n\n### `OptionSet`\nThe OptionSet structure provides the options to be chosen from, or sufficient data to fetch and interpret the options. All OptionSets have an `option_set_type` attribute that indicates the structure of the object that contains the options. The possible values are `options_array`, `equipment_category`, and `reference_list`. Other attributes on the OptionSet depend on the value of this attribute.\n- `options_array`\n  - `options` (array): An array of Option objects. Each item in the array represents an option that can be chosen.\n- `equipment_category`\n  - `equipment_category` (APIReference): A reference to an EquipmentCategory. Each item in the EquipmentCategory's `equipment` array represents one option that can be chosen.\n- `resource_list`\n  - `resource_list_url` (string): A reference (by URL) to a collection in the database. The URL may include query parameters. Each item in the resulting ResourceList's `results` array represents one option that can be chosen.\n<hr>\n\n### `Option`\nWhen the options are given in an `options_array`, each item in the array inherits from the Option structure. All Options have an `option_type` attribute that indicates the structure of the option. The value of this attribute indicates how the option should be handled, and each type has different attributes. The possible values and their corresponding attributes are listed below.\n- `reference` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to a Document that can be added to the list of options chosen.\n  - `item` (APIReference): A reference to the chosen item.\n- `action` - A terminal option. Contains information describing an action, for use within Multiattack actions.\n  - `action_name` (string): The name of the action, according to its `name` attribute.\n  - `count` (number | string): The number of times this action can be repeated if this option is chosen.\n  - `type` (string = `\"melee\" | \"ranged\" | \"ability\" | \"magic\"`, optional): For attack actions that can be either melee, ranged, abilities, or magic.\n- `multiple` - When this option is chosen, all of its child options are chosen, and must be resolved the same way as a normal option.\n  - `items` (array): An array of Option objects. All of them must be taken if the option is chosen.\n- `choice` - A nested choice. If this option is chosen, the Choice structure contained within must be resolved like a normal Choice structure, and the results are the chosen options.\n  - `choice` (Choice): The Choice to resolve.\n- `string` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to a string.\n  - `string` (string): The string.\n- `ideal` - A terminal option. Contains information about an ideal.\n  - `desc` (string): A description of the ideal.\n  - `alignments` (ApiReference[]): A list of alignments of those who might follow the ideal.\n- `counted_reference` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to something else in the API along with a count.\n  - `count` (number): Count.\n  - `of` (ApiReference): Thing being referenced.\n- `score_prerequisite` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to an ability score and a minimum score.\n  - `ability_score` (ApiReference): Ability score being referenced.\n  - `minimum_score` (number): The minimum score required to satisfy the prerequisite.\n- `ability_bonus` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to an ability score and a bonus\n  - `ability_score` (ApiReference): Ability score being referenced\n  - `bonus` (number): The bonus being applied to the ability score\n- `breath` - A terminal option: Contains a reference to information about a breath attack.\n  - `name` (string): Name of the breath.\n  - `dc` (DC): Difficulty check of the breath attack.\n  - `damage` ([Damage]): Damage dealt by the breath attack, if any.\n- `damage` - A terminal option. Contains information about damage.\n  - `damage_type` (ApiReference): Reference to type of damage.\n  - `damage_dice` (string): Damage expressed in dice (e.g. \"13d6\").\n  - `notes` (string): Information regarding the damage.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What is the SRD?\nThe SRD, or Systems Reference Document, contains guidelines for publishing content under the OGL. This allows for some of the data for D&D 5e to be open source. The API only covers data that can be found in the SRD. [Here's a link to the full text of the SRD.](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)\n\n### What is the OGL?\nThe Open Game License (OGL) is a public copyright license by Wizards of the Coast that may be used by tabletop role-playing game developers to grant permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some of the content designed for their games, notably game mechanics. However, they must share-alike copies and derivative works. [More information about the OGL can be found here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License)\n\n### A monster, spell, subclass, etc. is missing from the API / Database. Can I add it?\nPlease check if the data is within the SRD. If it is, feel free to open an issue or PR to add it yourself. Otherwise, due to legal reasons, we cannot add it.\n\n### Can this API be self hosted?\nYes it can! You can also host the data yourself if you don't want to use the API at all. You can also make changes and add extra data if you like. However, it is up to you to merge in new changes to the data and API.\n\n#### Can I publish is on <insert platform>? Is this free use?\nYes, you can. The API itself is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and the underlying data accessible via the API is supported under the SRD and OGL.\n\n# Status Page\n\nThe status page for the API can be found here: https://5e-bits.github.io/dnd-uptime/\n\n# Chat\n\nCome hang out with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7)!\n\n# Contribute\n\nThis API is built from two repositories.\n  - The repo containing the data lives here: https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-database\n  - The repo with the API implementation lives here: https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-srd-api\n\nThis is a evolving API and having fresh ideas are always welcome! You can\nopen an issue in either repo, open a PR for changes, or just discuss with\nother users in this discord.\n",

    "id": "docker.com:engine",
    "title": "Docker Engine API",
    "description": "The Engine API is an HTTP API served by Docker Engine. It is the API the Docker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker client can do can be done with the API.\n\nMost of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps` is `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers, which consists of several API calls.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"message\": \"page not found\"\n}\n```\n\n# Versioning\n\nThe API is usually changed in each release of Docker, so API calls are versioned to ensure that clients don't break.\n\nFor Docker Engine 17.09, the API version is 1.32. To lock to this version, you prefix the URL with `/v1.32`. For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.32/info`.\n\nEngine releases in the near future should support this version of the API, so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.\n\nIn previous versions of Docker, it was possible to access the API without providing a version. This behaviour is now deprecated will be removed in a future version of Docker.\n\nThe API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer Docker daemons.\n\nThis documentation is for version 1.33 of the API. Use this table to find documentation for previous versions of the API:\n\nDocker version  | API version | Changes\n----------------|-------------|---------\n17.09.x | [1.31](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.32/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-32-api-changes)\n17.07.x | [1.31](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.31/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-31-api-changes)\n17.06.x | [1.30](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-30-api-changes)\n17.05.x | [1.29](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.29/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-29-api-changes)\n17.04.x | [1.28](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.28/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-28-api-changes)\n17.03.1 | [1.27](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.27/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-27-api-changes)\n1.13.1 & 17.03.0 | [1.26](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.26/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-26-api-changes)\n1.13.0 | [1.25](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.25/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-25-api-changes)\n1.12.x | [1.24](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.24/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-24-api-changes)\n1.11.x | [1.23](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-23-api-changes)\n1.10.x | [1.22](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.22/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-22-api-changes)\n1.9.x | [1.21](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.21/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-21-api-changes)\n1.8.x | [1.20](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.20/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-20-api-changes)\n1.7.x | [1.19](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.19/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-19-api-changes)\n1.6.x | [1.18](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.18/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-18-api-changes)\n\n# Authentication\n\nAuthentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as `X-Registry-Auth` header as a Base64 encoded (JSON) string with the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n  \"username\": \"string\",\n  \"password\": \"string\",\n  \"email\": \"string\",\n  \"serveraddress\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this structure, double quotes are required.\n\nIf you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth), you can just pass this instead of credentials:\n\n```\n{\n  \"identitytoken\": \"9cbaf023786cd7...\"\n}\n```\n",

If you are upgrading from a previous version, take a look at the changelog section.\n\n# Authorization\n\n## Initial authorization\n\nThere are three main steps in the OAuth 2.0 authentication workflow:\n\n1. Redirect the provider to the authorization page.\n2. The provider authorizes your application and is redirected back to\n   your web application.\n3. Your application exchanges the `authorization_code` that came with\n   the redirect for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.\n\n### Step 1: Redirect to drchrono\n\nThe first step is redirecting your user to drchrono, typically with a button\nlabeled \"Connect to drchrono\" or \"Login with drchrono\".  This is just a link that\ntakes your user to the following URL:\n\n    https://drchrono.com/o/authorize/?redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED&response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID_ENCODED&scope=SCOPES_ENCODED\n\n- `REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of the redirect URI (as registered for your application and used in later steps).\n- `CLIENT_ID_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of your application's client ID.\n- `SCOPES_ENCODED` is a URL-encoded version of a space-separated list of scopes, which can be found in each endpoint or omitted to default to all scopes.\n\nThe `scope` parameter consists of an optional, space-separated list of scopes your application is requesting.\nIf omitted, all scopes will be requested.\n\nScopes are of the form `BASE_SCOPE:[read|write]` where `BASE_SCOPE` is any of `user`, `calendar`, `patients`, `patients:summary`, `billing`, `clinical` and `labs`.\nYou should request only the scopes you need.\nFor instance, an application which sends \"Happy Birthday!\" emails to a doctor's patients on their birthdays would use the scope parameter `\"patients:summary:read\"`,\nwhile one that allows patients to schedule appointments online would need at least\n`\"patients:summary:read patients:summary:write calendar:read calendar:write clinical:read clinical:write\"`.\n\n### Step 2: Provider authorization\n\nAfter logging in (if necessary), the provider will be presented with a screen\nwith your application's name and the list of permissions you requested (via the\n`scope` parameter).\n\nWhen they click the \"Authorize\" button, they will be redirected to your redirect\nURI with a `code` query parameter appended, which contains an authorization code to be\nused in step 3.  If they click the \"Cancel\" button, they will be redirected to\nyour redirect URI with `error=access_denied` instead.\n\nNote: This authorization code expires extremely quickly, so you must perform\nstep 3 immediately, ideally before rendering the resulting page for the end\nuser.\n\n### Step 3: Token exchange\n\nThe `code` obtained from step 2 is usable exactly once to obtain an access token\nand refresh token.  Here is an example token exchange in Python:\n\n    import datetime, pytz, requests\n\n    if 'error' in get_params:\n        raise ValueError('Error authorizing application: %s' % get_params[error])\n\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'code': get_params['code'],\n        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',\n        'redirect_uri': 'http://mytestapp.com/redirect_uri',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    data = response.json()\n\n    # Save these in your database associated with the user\n    access_token = data['access_token']\n    refresh_token = data['refresh_token']\n    expires_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.utc) + datetime.timedelta(seconds=data['expires_in'])\n\nYou now have all you need to make API requests authenticated as that provider.\nWhen using this access token, you'll only be able to access the data that the\nuser has access to and that you have been granted permissions for.\n\n## Refreshing an access token\n\nAccess tokens only last 48 hours (given in seconds in the `'expires_in'` key in\nthe token exchange step above), so they occasionally need to be refreshed.  It\nwould be inconvenient to ask the user to re-authorize every time, so instead you\ncan use the refresh token like the original authorization to obtain a new access\ntoken.  Replace the `code` parameter with `refresh_token`, change the value\n`grant_type` from `authorization_code` to `refresh_token`, and omit the\n`redirect_uri` parameter.\n\nExample in Python:\n\n    ...\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'refresh_token': get_refresh_token(),\n        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    ...\n\n# Webhooks\n\nIn order to use drchrono API webhooks, you first need to have an API application on file\n(even if it is in Test Model).\nEach API webhook is associated with one API application, go to\n<a href=\"/api-management/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to set up both API applications and webhooks!\n\nOnce you registered an API application, you will see webhook section in each saved API applications.\nCreate a webhook and register some events there and save all the changes, then you are good to go!\n\n## Webhooks setup\n\nAll fields under webhooks section are required.\n\n**Callback URL**\nCallback URl is used to receive all hooks when subscribed events are triggered. This should be an URL under your control.\n\n**Secret token**\nSecret token is used to verify webhooks, this is very important, please set something with high entropy. Also we will\ntalk more about this later.\n\n**Events**\n\nEvents is used to register events you want to receiver notification when they happen. Currently we support following events.\n\nEvent name | Event description\n---------- | -----------------\n`APPOINTMENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is created\n`APPOINTMENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is modified\n`PATIENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is created\n`PATIENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is modified\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is created\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is modified\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is created\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is modified\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is created\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is modified\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_LOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is locked\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_UNLOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is unlocked\n`TASK_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is created\n`TASK_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is modified and any time creation, modification and deletion of task notes, associated task item\n`TASK_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is deleted\n\n\n## Webhooks verification\n\nIn order to make sure the callback URL in webhook is under your control, we added a verification\nstep before we send any hooks out to you.\n\nVerification can be done by clicking \"Verify webhook\" button in webhooks setup page. After you click\nthe button, we will send a `GET` request to the callback URL, along with a parameter called `msg`.\n\nPlease use your webhook's secret token as hash key and SHA-256 as digest constructor, hash the `msg` value with\n<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104.html\">HMAC algorithm</a>.\nAnd we expect a `200` JSON response, in JSON response body, there should be a key called `secret_token` existing, and its value should be\nequal to the <strong>hashed</strong> `msg`. Otherwise, verification will fail.\n\nHere is an example webhook verification in Python:\n\n    import hashlib, hmac\n\n    def webhook_verify(request):\n        secret_token = hmac.new(WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN, request.GET['msg'], hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()\n        return json_response({\n            'secret_token': secret_token\n        })\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n<b>Note:</b> Verification will be needed when webhook is first created and anytime callback URl is changed.\n</div>\n\n\n## Webhooks header and body\n\n**Header**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`X-drchrono-event` | Event that triggered this hook, could be any one event above or `PING`\n`X-drchrono-signature` | Secret token associated with this webhook\n`X-drchrono-delivery` | ID of this delivery\n\n**Body**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`receiver` | This will be an JSON representation of the webhook\n`object` | This will be an JSON representation of the object related to the triggered event, this would share same serializer as drchrono API\n\n## Webhooks ping and deliveries\n\nWebhooks ping and deliveries will be sent as `POST` requests.\n\n**PING**:\n\nYou can always ping your webhook to check things, by clicking the \"Ping webhook\" button in webhook setup page. And a hook with header `X-drchrono-event: PING` would be sent to the callback URL.\n\n**Deliveries**:\n\nYou can check recent deliveries by clicking the \"deliveries\" link in webhook setup page. And you can resend a hook by clicking \"redeliver\" button after select a specific delivery.\n\n## Webhooks delivery mechanism\n\nWe will delivery a hook the moment a subscribed event is triggered. We will not record any response header or body you send back after you receive the hook.\nHowever we only consider the response status code. We will consider any `2xx` responses as successfully delivered.\nAny other responses, like `302` would be considered failing.\nAnd we will try to redeliver unsuccessfully delivered hooks 3 times, first redeliver happens at 1 hour after the initial event,\nsecond receliver happens 3 hours after the initial event, and the third redeliver happens 7 hours after the initial event.\nAfter these redeliveries, if the delivery is still unsuccessful, you have to redeliver it by hand.\n\n\n## Webhooks security\n\nYou may want to secure your webhooks to only consider requests send out from drchrono. And this is where <code>secret_token</code> is needed in\nrequest header.\nTry to set the <code>secret_token</code> to something with high entropy, a good example could be taking the output of\n<code>ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'</code>.\nAfter this, you might want to verify all request headers you received on your server with this token.\n\n\n# iframe integration\n\nSome API apps provide additional functionality for interacting with patient data\nnot offered by drchrono, and can benefit by being incorporated into drchrono's\npatient information page via iframe.  We have created a simple API to make this\npossible.\n\nTo make an existing API application accessible via an iframe on the patient\npage, you need to update either \"Patient iframe\" or \"Clinical note iframe\" section in API management page,\nto make the iframe to appear on (either the patient page or the clinical note page),\nwith the URL that the iframe will use for each page, and the height it should\nhave. The application will be reviewed before it is approved to ensure that it\nis functional and secure.\n\n## Register a Doctor\n\niframe applications will appear as choices on the left-hand menu of the patient\npage for doctors registered with your application.  To register a doctor with\nyour application, make a `POST` request to the `/api/iframe_integration`\nendpoint using the access token for the corresponding doctor. This endpoint does not\nexpect any payload.\n\nTo disable your iframe application for a doctor, make a `DELETE` request to the\nsame endpoint.\n\n## Populating the iframe\n\nThere are two places where the iframe can be displayed, either within the\npatient detail page or the clinical note page, shown below respectively:\n\n<img src=\"{% asset 'public/images/iframe_patient_page.png' %}\" alt=\"Iframe on the patient page\"/>\n\n<img src=\"{% asset 'public/images/iframe_clinical_note.png' %}\" alt=\"Iframe on the clinical note page\"/>\n\nWhen requesting approval for your iframe app, you must specify a URL for one or\nboth of these pages which will serve as the base URL for your IFrame\ncontents. When a doctor views your iframe, the source URL will have various\nquery parameters appended to it, for example for the patient page the `src`\nparameter of the IFrame will be:\n\n```\n<iframe_url>?doctor_id=<doctor_id>&patient_id=<patient_id>&practice_id=<practice_id>&iat=<iat>&jwt=<jwt>\n```\n\nThe `jwt` parameter is crucial if your application transfers any sort of PHI and\ndoes not implement its own login system.  It encapsulates the other parameters\nin a [JSON web token (JWT)](http://jwt.io) and signs them using SHA-256 HMAC\nwith your `client_secret` as the key.  This verifies that the iframe is being\nloaded within one of drchrono's pages by an authorized user.  In production, you\nshould validate the JWT using an approved library (which are listed on the\n[official site](http://jwt.io)), and only use the parameters extracted from the\nJWT.  Using Python and Django, this might look like:\n\n    import jwt\n\n    CLIENT_SECRET = <client_secret>\n    MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS = 60\n\n    def validate_parameters(request):\n        token = request.GET['jwt']\n\n        return jwt.decode(token, CLIENT_SECRET, algorithms=['HS256'], leeway=MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS)\n\nModern browsers' same-origin policy means that data cannot be passed between\nyour application and drchrono's page through the iframe.  Therefore, interaction\nmust happen through the API, using information provided in JWT.\n\n# Versions and deprecation\n\n## Stability Policy\n\nChanges to this API version will be limited to adding endpoints, or adding fields to existing\nendpoints, or adding optional query parameters. Any new fields which are not read-only will be optional.\n\n## Deprecation Policy\n\nThe drchrono API is versioned. Versions can be in the following states:\n\n* **Active:** This is our latest and greatest version of the API. It is actively supported by\nour API team and is improved upon with new features, bug fixes and optimizations that do\nnot break backwards compatibility.\n\n* **Deprecated:** A deprecated API version is considered second best--having been\nsurpassed by our active API version. An API version remains in this state for one year,\nafter which time it falls to the not supported state. A deprecated API version is passively supported;\nwhile it won't be removed until becoming unsupported, it may not receive new features but will likely\nbe subject to security updates and performance improvements.\n\n* **Unsupported:** An API version in the not supported state may be deactivated at any\ntime. An application using an unsupported API version should migrate to an active API version.\n\n## Version Map\n| Version Name | Previous Name | Start Date | Deprecation Date |\n|--------------|---------------|------------|------------------|\n| v2           | v2015_08      | 08/2015    | TBA              |\n| v3           | v2016_06      | 06/2016    |                  |\n| v4           | N/A           | 09/2018    |                  |\n\nIf you are looking for documentation for an older version\n\n- [V4(Hunt Valley)](/api-docs-old/v4/documentation) (old V4 documentation)\n- [V3(Sunnyvale)](/api-docs-old/v3/documentation)\n- [V2(Mountain View)](/api-docs-old/v2/documentation)\n\n# Changelog\n\nHere's changelog for different versions\n\n- [V4 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v4/changelog)\n- [V3 changelog](/api-docs-old/v3/changelog)\n\n",

These endpoints help the user to find data of interest using different parameters provided by the API endpoint.\nFor example,\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/proteins?accession=A0A023GRW5 -> will provide protein information about accession 'A0A023GRW5' including its interactions, functions, cross-references, variations and more.\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/activities?moleculeChemblId=CHEMBL465983 -> will provide ChEMBL bio-interactions related information including targets and bio-activity measurements associated with molecule chembl id 'CHEMBL465983'\n\n**Knowledge graphs**\nAnother use case of CROssBAR's API endpoints is in building knowledge graphs. These endpoints can be *weaved* together (output from one API endpoint fed as input to another API endpoint) programmatically to link nodes like protein, disease, drugs etc. as nodes of the graph. The endpoints are designed to be independent from each other which allows users the flexibility to drive biological networks from any facet e.g drug-centric, disease-centric, gene-centric etc. Our service for knowledge graph construction is available at https://crossbar.kansil.org.\nAn example for the part of the background queries on the CROssBAR API during the construction of a knowledge graph, \n(with the aim of keeping the example simple, we have only included the processes related to pathways, genes/proteins and drugs/compounds)\nIn this example, we would like to find bio-active compounds (with a pChEMBL value threshold of at least 6.0) & drugs targeting all proteins belonging to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\" pathway (based on Reactome pathway annotations).\nThis can be achieved by using endpoints listed on this swagger documentation as illustrated in following steps-\nFind bio-active compounds (with a pChEMBL value threshold of at least 6.0) & drugs targeting all proteins belonging to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\" pathway (based on Reactome annotations)\nThis can be achieved by using endpoints listed on [this swagger documentation](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/swagger-ui.html) as illustrated in following steps-\n1. Get all proteins from “/proteins” API endpoint which have a reactome pathway name equal to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\".\n2. From the collection of uniprot protein accessions collected from step 1 above, we query “/targets” API endpoint to obtain the ‘target_chembl_id’s of these proteins.\n3. From the collection of target_chembl_ids collected from step 2 above, we query “/activities” API endpoint with pChEMBL value >=6, to obtain the ’molecule_chembl_id’s of the molecules that we need. \n4. From the collection of uniprot protein accessions collected from step 1 above, we find out Drug names and ids from the “/drugs” API endpoint that targets our proteins.\n5. From the collection of ’molecule_chembl_id’s obtained in step3, we query “/molecules” endpoint to get the compounds that are interacting with the genes/proteins belonging to the “WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking” pathway.",

    "description": "Download [OpenAPI 3.0 Specification](/OpenAPI-Enode-v1.4.0.json)\n\nDownload [Postman Collection](/Postman-Enode-v1.4.0.json)\n\nThe Enode API is designed to make smart charging applications easy to develop. We provide an abstraction layer that reduces the complexity when extracting vehicle data and sending commands to vehicles from a variety of manufacturers.\n\nThe API has a RESTful architecture and utilizes OAuth2 authorization.\n\nWe are always available to handle any issues or just answer your questions. Feel free to reach out on post@enode.io\n\n\n## Registration for API access\nIn order to use the API you will need a `client_id` and `client_secret`. Please contact us if you are interested in using our API in production, and we will provide these credentials.\n\n# Authorization\nVehicle / hardware access via the Enode API is granted to your application by the User in a standard OAuth `Authorization Code` flow.\n\n> The authorization scheme documented here is the recommended approach for most situations. However, it is also possible to user other OAuth flows, non-confidential clients, and temporary users. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about your use-case or the integration of your existing infrastructure.\n\n### Preparation: Configure your OAuth client\n\nBecause Enode API implements the OAuth 2.0 spec completely and without modifications, you can avoid rolling your own OAuth client implementation and instead use a well-supported and battle-tested implementation. This is strongly recommended. Information on available OAuth clients for many languages is available [here](https://oauth.net/code/)\n\nTo configure your chosen OAuth client, you will need these details:\n- Your `client_id`\n- Your `client_secret`\n- Authorization URL: `https://link.test.enode.io/oauth2/auth`\n- Token URL: `https://link.test.enode.io/oauth2/token`\n\n```javascript\n// Node.js + openid-client example\nconst enodeIssuer = await Issuer.discover('https://link.test.enode.io');\nconst client = new enodeIssuer.Client({\n  client_id: 'xyz',\n  client_secret: 'shhhhh',\n  redirect_uris: ['http://localhost:5000/callback'],\n  response_types: ['code'],\n});\n```\n\n\n### Preparation: Obtain a client access token via OAuth Client Credentials Grant\nYour OAuth client will have a method for using the `OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant` to obtain an access token.\n\n```javascript\n// Node.js + openid-client example\nconst clientAccessToken = await client.grant({grant_type: \"client_credentials\"});\n```\n\nThis access token belongs to your client and is used for administrative actions, such as the next step.\n\nThis token should be cached by your server and reused until it expires, at which point your server should request a new one.\n\n\n\n### Step 1. Generate an Enode Link session for your User and launch the OAuth flow\n\nWhen your User indicates that they want to connect their hardware to your app, your server must call [Link User](#operation/postUsersUseridLink) to generate an Enode Link session for your User. The User ID can be any string that uniquely identifies the User, but it is recommended that you use the primary key by which you identify the User within your application.\n\nExample Request:\n```\nPOST /users/{userId}/link HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer {access_token}\n{\n  \"forceLanguage\": \"nb-NO\",\n  \"vendor\": \"Tesla\",\n}\n```\n\nExample Response:\n```\n{\n    \"linkState\": \"ZjE2MzMxMGFiYmU4MzcxOTU1ZmRjMTU5NGU2ZmE4YTU3NjViMzIwY2YzNG\",\n}\n```\n\nThe returned linkState must be stored by your server, attached to the session of the authenticated user for which it was generated.\n\nYour OAuth client will provide a method to construct an authorization URL for your user. That method will require these details:\n- Redirect URI - The URI to which your user should be redirected when the Oauth flow completes\n- Scope - The OAuth scope(s) you wish to request access to (see list of valid values [here](#section/Authentication/AccessTokenBearer))\n- State - The value of `linkState` from the request above\n\nTo launch the OAuth flow, send your user to the authorization URL constructed by your OAuth client. This can be done in an embedded webview within a native iOS/Android app, or in the system's default browser.\n\n```javascript\n// Node.js + openid-client + express example\n\n// Construct an OAuth authorization URL\nconst authorizationUrl = client.authorizationUrl({\n  scope: \"offline_access all\",\n  state: linkState\n});\n\n// Redirect user to authorization URL\nres.redirect(authorizationUrl);\n```\n\n\n### Step 2. User grants consent\nIn the Link UI webapp the user will follow 3 steps:\n\n1. Choose their hardware from a list of supported manufacturers (EVs and charging boxes). For certain EV makes it will be necessary to also select a charge box.\n2. For each selection, the user will be presented with the login screen for that particular hardware. The user must successfully log in.\n3. A summary of the requested scopes will be presented to the user. The user must choose whether to grant access to your application.\n\n\n### Step 3. OAuth flow concludes with a callback\nWhen the user has completed their interactions, they will be redirected to the `Redirect URI` you provided in Step 1, with various metadata appended as query parameters.\n\nYour OAuth client will have a method to parse and validate that metadata, and fetch the granted access and refresh tokens.\n\nAmong that metadata will be a `state` value - you must verify that it is equal to the `linkState` value persisted in Step 1, as [a countermeasure against CSRF attacks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.8).\n\n```javascript\n// Node.js + openid-client + express example\n\n// Fetch linkState from user session\nconst linkState = get(req, 'session.linkState');\n\n// Parse relevant parameters from request URL\nconst params = client.callbackParams(req);\n\n// Exchange authorization code for access and refresh tokens\n// In this example, openid-client does the linkState validation check for us\nconst tokenSet = await client.oauthCallback('http://localhost:5000/callback', params, {state: linkState})\n```\n\nWith the access token in hand, you can now access resources on behalf of the user.\n\n\n# Errors And Problems\n## OAuth Authorization Request\n\nWhen the User has completed the process of allowing/denying access in Enode Link, they will be redirected to your configured redirect URI. If something has gone wrong, query parameters `error` and `error_description` will be set as documented in [Section 4.1.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1) of the OAuth 2.0 spec:\n\n|error                      |error_description|\n|---------------------------|-----------------|\n|invalid_request            |The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed.|\n|unauthorized_client        |The client is not authorized to request an authorization code using this method.|\n|access_denied              |The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.|\n|unsupported_response_type  |The authorization server does not support obtaining an authorization code using this method.|\n|invalid_scope              |The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.|\n|server_error               |The authorization server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.|\n|temporarily_unavailable    |The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server|\n\nExample:\n```\nhttps://website.example/oauth_callback?state=e0a86fe5&error=access_denied&error_description=The+resource+owner+or+authorization+server+denied+the+request.\n```\n\n\n## Errors when accessing a User's resources\n\nWhen using an `access_token` to access a User's resources, the following HTTP Status Codes in the 4XX range may be encountered:\n\n|HTTP Status Code           |Explanation      |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|\n|400 Bad Request            |The request payload has failed schema validation / parsing\n|401 Unauthorized           |Authentication details are missing or invalid\n|403 Forbidden              |Authentication succeeded, but the authenticated user doesn't have access to the resource\n|404 Not Found              |A non-existent resource is requested\n|429 Too Many Requests      |Rate limiting by the vendor has prevented us from completing the request\n\n\nIn all cases, an [RFC7807 Problem Details](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) body is returned to aid in debugging.\n\nExample:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/problem+json\n{\n  \"type\": \"https://docs.enode.io/problems/payload-validation-error\",\n  \"title\": \"Payload validation failed\",\n  \"detail\": \"\\\"authorizationRequest.scope\\\" is required\",\n}\n```\n\n",

ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n   SDW Rest Services provides multiple service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on public water systems regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  The returned results reflect data drawn from EPA's Federal Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) database.\n\\\nThe get_systems, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together.\n\\\nThe recommended use scenario for get_systems, get_qid, and get_downoad is:\n\\\n <b>1)</b>  Use get_systems to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.\n <b>2)</b>  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of water system results.\n <b>3)</b>  Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of water system information that meets the QID query criteria.\n\\\n\\\nUse the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.  Use the Metadata service endpoint for a list of available output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your customized output. \n\\\nAdditional ECHO Resources:   <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services\">Web Services</a>, <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/about-the-data\">About ECHO's Data</a>, <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads\">Data Downloads</a>\n ",

[Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. \n\n There are a lot of data, and a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in the `/schedule_a/` endpoints. \n\n <b class=\"body\" id=\"getting_started_head\">Getting started with the openFEC API</b><br> \n\n If you would like to use the FEC's API programmatically, you can sign up for your own API key using our form. Alternatively, you can still try out our API without an API key by using the web interface and using DEMO_KEY. Note that when you use the openFEC API you are subject to the [Terms of Service](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md) and [Acceptable Use policy](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/ACCEPTABLE-USE-POLICY.md). \n\n Signing up for an API key will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 7,200 calls an hour (120 calls per minute) to <a href=\"mailto:APIinfo@fec.gov\">APIinfo@fec.gov</a>. You can also ask questions and discuss the data in a community led [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). \n\n The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. \n\n A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations.

Information is made available from events operating around the world.</p>\n<p>For FRC, information is made available by the Field Management System (FMS) server operating at each event site. The FMS will attempt to sync all data from the event to \"the cloud\" as long as internet is available at the venue. If internet is unavailable, or \"goes down\" during the event, the FMS will automatically sync all data from the time the system was offline as soon as the connection is restored. The API will provide data as soon as it has synced, and we do not add any artificial delays. If you are receiving \"stale\" data, it may be because of connectivity problems at the venue. We recommend you try again later, and post on the FIRST FMS TeamForge site if the problem persists. <em>(Note: FMS does not sync while a match is running, so data that has to do with a particular match should become available once the score has been revealed to the audience at the event.)</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"migration-and-program-notes\">Migration and Program Notes:</h3>\n<p>Pay close attention to the addresses for calling the various endpoints- as well as the notes regarding endpoints with multiple possible responses (i.e. score details and rankings).</p>\n<h1 id=\"documentation-notes\">Documentation Notes</h1>\n<p>All times are listed in the local time to the event venue. HTTP-date values will show their timezone.</p>\n<p>If you specify a parameter, but no value for that parameter, it will be ignored. For example, if you request <strong>URL?teamNumber=</strong> the <strong>teamNumber</strong> parameter would be ignored.</p>\n<p>We will continue to support the current version of the API plus one version older. Old APIs are depricated once a version \"two times newer\" is available, at minimum 6 months. For example, version 2.0 and 1.0 are supported right now, but 1.0 will not be supported once 2.1 (or 3.0) is available. Versions may also be retired earlier with prior notice here in the documentation.</p>\n<p>The full host address of the API is needed in all calls. The version number is required in each call in order to ensure your requests are made (and responses are returned) in the formats you anticipate. The version number for this documentation is found on the top of the page, in the title. If you call this version number, the API responses will match the formats listed below.</p>\n<p>All of the APIs are capable of accepting the <strong>Accept</strong> HTTP header with either <strong>application/xml</strong> or <strong>application/json</strong> based on the desired return type. Any API call that results in an <strong>HTTP Status Code</strong> other than <strong>200 (OK)</strong> will only be shown here as an <strong>application/json</strong> response to save space, but the content is the same regardless of the request type. All response will have a <strong>Content-Length</strong> and <strong>Date</strong> response header, but those are not shown in the documentaiton.</p>\n<p>For all APIs that accept a query string in addition to the URI base, the order of parameters do not matter, but the name shown in the documentation must match exactly, as does the associated value format as described in details.</p>\n<p>For response codes that are not <strong>HTTP 200 (OK)</strong>, the documentation will show a body message that represents a possible response value. While the \"title\" of the <strong>HTTP Status Code</strong> will match those shown in the response codes documentation section exactly, the body of the response will be a more detailed explanation of why that status code is being returned and may not always be exactly as shown in the examples.</p>\n<p>None of the APIs will show possible return here in the documentation of <strong>HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)</strong>, but that code applies to all APIs as a possible response if the request is made without a valid token.</p>\n<h3 id=\"last-modified-fms-onlymodifiedsince-and-if-modified-since-headers\">Last-Modified, FMS-OnlyModifiedSince, and If-Modified-Since Headers</h3>\n<p>The FRC Events API utilizes the <strong>Last-Modified</strong> and <strong>If-Modified-Since</strong> Headers to communicate with consumers regarding the age of the data they are requesting. With a couple of exceptions, all calls will return a <strong>Last-Modified</strong> Header set with the time at which the data at that endpoint was last modified. The Header will always be set in the HTTP-date format, as described in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html\">HTTP Protocol</a>. There are two exceptions: the <strong>Last-Modified</strong> Header is not set if the endpoint returns no results (such as a request for a schedule with no matches) and will also not be set if the request was an <strong>HTTP DELETE</strong>.</p>\n<p>Consumers should keep track of the <strong>Last-Modified</strong> Header, and return it on subsequent calls to the same endpoint as the <strong>If-Modified-Since</strong>. The server will recognize this request, and will only return a result if the data has been modified since the last request. If no changes have been made, an <strong>HTTP 304</strong> will be returned. If data has been modified, ALL data on that call will be returned (for \"only modified\" data, see below).</p>\n<p>The FRC Events API also allows a custom header used to filter the return data to a specific subset. This is done by specifying a <strong>FMS-OnlyModifiedSince</strong> header with each call. As with the <strong>If-Modified-Since</strong> header, consumers should keep track of the <strong>Last-Modified</strong> Header, and return it on subsequent calls to the same endpoint as the <strong>FMS-OnlyModifiedSince</strong> Header. The server will recognize this request, and will only return a result if the data has been modified since the last request, and, if returned, the data will only be those portions modified since the included date. If no changes, have been made, an <strong>HTTP 304</strong> will be returned. Using this method, the server and consumer save processing time by only receiving modified data that is in need of update on the consumer side.</p>\n<p>If the Headers are improperly passed (such as the wrong Day of Week for the matching date, or a date in the future), the endpoint will simply ignore the Header and return all results. If both headers are specified, the request will be denied.</p>\n<h1 id=\"response-codes\">Response Codes</h1>\n<p>The FRC Events API HTTP Status Codes correspond with the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\">common codes</a>, but occasionally with different \"titles\". The \"title\" used by the API is shown next to each of the below possible response HTTP Status Codes. Throughout the documentation, Apiary may automatically show the common \"title\" in example returns (like \"Not Found\" for 404) but on the production server, the \"title\" will instead match those listed below.</p>\n<pre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"><code>HTTP 200 - \"OK\"\n</code></pre><p>The request has succeeded. An entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the response. This will be returned as the HTTP Status Code for all request that succeed, even if the body is empty (such as an event that has no rankings, but with a valid season and event code were used)</p>\n<pre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"><code>HTTP 304 - \"Not Modified\"\n</code></pre><p>When utilizing a Header that allows filtered data returns, such as <strong>If-Modified-Since</strong>, this response indicates that no data meets the request.</p>\n<pre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"><code>HTTP 400 - \"Invalid Season Requested\"/\"Malformed Parameter Format In Request\"/\"Missing Parameter In Request\"/\"Invalid API Version Requested\":\n</code></pre><p>The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. Specifically for this API, a 400 response indicates that the requested URI matches with a valid API, but one or more required parameter was malformed or invalid. Examples include an event code that is too short or team number that contains a letter.</p>\n<pre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"><code>HTTP 401 - \"Unauthorized\"\n</code></pre><p>All requests against the API require authentication via a valid user token. Failing to provide one, or providing an invalid one, will warrant a 401 response. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field.</p>\n<pre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"><code>HTTP 404 - \"Invalid Event Requested\"\n</code></pre><p>Even though the 404 code usually indicates any not found status, a 404 will only be issued in this API when an event cannot be found for the requested season and event code. If the request didn't match a valid API or there were malformed parameters, the response would not receive a 404 but rather a 400 or 501. If this HTTP code is received, the season was a valid season and the event code matched the acceptable style of an event code, but there were no records of an event matching the combination of that season and event code. For example, HTTP 404 would be issued when the event had a different code in the requested season (the codes can change year to year based on event location).</p>\n<pre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"><code>HTTP 500 - \"Internal Server Error\"\n</code></pre><p>The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. This is a code sent directly by the server, and has no special alternate definition specific to this API.</p>\n<pre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"><code>HTTP 501 - \"Request Did Not Match Any Current API Pattern\"\n</code></pre><p>The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. Specifically, the request pattern did not match any of the possible APIs, and thus processing was discontinued. This code is also issued when too many optional parameters were included in a single request and fulfilling it would make the result confusing or misleading. Each API will specify which parameters or combination of parameters can be used at the same time.</p>\n<pre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"><code>HTTP 503 - \"Service Unavailable\"\n</code></pre><p>The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. This code will not always appear, sometimes the server may outright refuse the connection instead. This is a code sent directly by the server, and has no special alternate definition specific to this API.</p>\n<p>See the notes at the top of this documentation for important information about HTTP Status Codes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"authorization\">Authorization</h1>\n<p>In order to make calls against the FRC Events API, you must include an HTTP Header called <strong>Authorization</strong> with the value set as specified below. If a request is made without this header, processing stops and an <strong>HTTP 401</strong> is issued. All <strong>Authorization</strong> headers follow the same format:</p>\n<p>Authorization: Basic 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</p>\n<p>Where the Zeros are replaced by your Token. The Token can be formed by taking your <strong>username</strong> and your <strong>AuthorizationKey</strong> and adding a colon. For example, if your <strong>username</strong> is sampleuser and your <strong>AuthorizationKey</strong> is 7eaa6338-a097-4221-ac04-b6120fcc4d49 you would have this string:</p>\n<p><strong>sampleuser:7eaa6338-a097-4221-ac04-b6120fcc4d49</strong></p>\n<p>This string must then be encoded using Base64 Encoded to form the Token, which will be the same length as the example above, but include letters and numbers. For our example, we would have:</p>\n<p>c2FtcGxldXNlcjo3ZWFhNjMzOC1hMDk3LTQyMjEtYWMwNC1iNjEyMGZjYzRkNDk=</p>\n<p><strong>NOTICE</strong>: Publicly distributing an application, code snippet, etc, that has your username and token in it, encoded or not, WILL result in your token being blocked from the API. Each user should apply for their own token.</p>\n<p>If you wish to acquire a token for your development, you may do so by requesting a token through our automated system on <a href=\"https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/services/API\">this website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>AUTOMATED REMOVAL</strong>: If you do not activate your account within 72 hours of making your request for a token, or if you do not make at least one API request every twelve (12) months, your account/token will be marked as disabled for inactivity and subject to being deleted. (This policy does not apply to accounts with special operating agreements with FIRST)</p>\n<h3 id=\"http401-and-authorization\">HTTP401 and Authorization</h3>\n<p>Each Token can be individually enabled and disabled by <em>FIRST</em>. As such, a normally valid combination of <strong>username</strong> and <strong>AuthorizationToken</strong> could still be rejected. The possible return messages you may see in these instances are:</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Token</strong> (You supplied an AuthorizationToken, but it wasn't correct)</p>\n<p><strong>Account Disabled, Contact Support</strong> (You have been disabled for excessive traffic or abuse. Contact support)</p>\n<p><strong>Username Not Found</strong> (A username was found, but didn't match any on file)</p>\n<p><strong>Unable To Determine Authorization Token</strong> (The format of the <strong>Authorization</strong> header was incorrect)</p>\n</body></html>",

    "description": "Welcome to our current iteration of our REST API. While we encourage you to upgrade to v2.0 we will continue support for our [SOAP API](https://github.com/fulfillment/soap-integration).\n\n# Versioning\n\nThe Fulfillment.com (FDC) REST API is version controlled and backwards compatible. We have many future APIs scheduled for publication within our v2.0 spec so please be prepared for us to add data nodes in our responses, however, we will not remove knowledge from previously published APIs.\n\n#### A Current Response\n\n```javascript\n{\n  id: 123\n}\n```\n\n#### A Potential Future Response\n\n```javascript\n{\n  id: 123,\n  reason: \"More Knowledge\"\n}\n```\n\n# Getting Started\n\nWe use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate clients, you can choose [implicit](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/) or [password](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password/) grant type. To obtain an OAuth `client_id` and `client_secret` contact your account executive.\n\n**Tip**: Generate an additional login and use those credentials for your integration so that changes are accredited to that \"user\".\n\nYou are now ready to make requests to our other APIs by filling your `Authorization` header with `Bearer {access_token}`.\n\n## Perpetuating Access\n\nPerpetuating access to FDC without storing your password locally can be achieved using the `refresh_token` returned by [POST /oauth/access_token](#operation/generateToken).\n\nA simple concept to achieve this is outlined below.\n\n1. Your application/script will ask you for your `username` and `password`, your `client_id` and `client_secret` will be accessible via a DB or ENV.\n2. [Request an access_token](#operation/generateToken)\n  + Your function should be capable of formatting your request for both a `grant_type` of \\\"password\\\" (step 1) and \\\"refresh_token\\\" (step 4).\n3. Store the `access_token` and `refresh_token` so future requests can skip step 1\n4. When the `access_token` expires request anew using your `refresh_token`, replace both tokens in local storage.\n\n+ If this fails you will have to revert to step 1.\n\nAlternatively if you choose for your application/script to have access to your `username` and `password` you can skip step 4.\n\nIn all scenarios we recommend storing all credentials outside your codebase.\n\n## Date Time Definitions\n\nWe will report all date-time stamps using the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard. When using listing API's where fromDate and toDate are available note that both dates are inclusive while requiring the fromDate to be before or at the toDate.\n\n### The Fulfillment Process\n\nMany steps are required to fulfill your order we report back to you three fundamental milestones inside the orders model.\n\n* `recordedOn` When we received your order. This will never change.\n\n* `dispatchDate` When the current iteration of your order was scheduled for fulfillment. This may change however it is an indicator that the physical process of fulfillment has begun and a tracking number has been **assigned** to your order. The tracking number **MAY CHANGE**. You will not be able to cancel an order once it has been dispatched. If you need to recall an order that has been dispatched please contact your account executive.\n\n* `departDate` When we recorded your order passing our final inspection and placed with the carrier. At this point it is **safe to inform the consignee** of the tracking number as it will not change.\n\n## Evaluating Error Responses\n\nWe currently return two different error models, with and without context. All errors will include a `message` node while errors with `context` will include additional information designed to save you time when encountering highly probable errors. For example, when you send us a request to create a duplicate order, we will reject your request and the context will include the FDC order `id` so that you may record it for your records.\n\n### Without Context\n\nNew order with missing required fields.\n\n| Header | Response |\n| ------ | -------- |\n| Status | `400 Bad Request` |\n\n```javascript\n{    \n  \"message\": \"Invalid request body\"\n}\n```\n\n### With Context\n\nNew order with duplicate `merchantOrderId`.\n\n| Header | Response |\n| ------ | -------- |\n| Status | `409 Conflict` |\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"message\": \"Duplicate Order\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"id\": 123\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Status Codes\n\nCodes are a concatenation of State, Stage, and Detail.\n\n`^([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})$`\n\n| Code | State              | Stage    | Detail         |\n| ---- | ------------------ | -------- | -------------- |\n| 010101 | Processing Order | Recieved | Customer Order |\n| 010102 | Processing Order | Recieved | Recieved |\n| 010201 | Processing Order | Approved | |\n| 010301 | Processing Order | Hold | Merchant Stock |\n| 010302 | Processing Order | Hold | Merchant Funds |\n| 010303 | Processing Order | Hold | For Merchant |\n| 010304 | Processing Order | Hold | Oversized Shipment |\n| 010305 | Processing Order | Hold | Invalid Parent Order |\n| 010306 | Processing Order | Hold | Invalid Address |\n| 010307 | Processing Order | Hold | By Admin |\n| 010401 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Incomplete Address |\n| 010402 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Locality |\n| 010403 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Region |\n| 010404 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Address Not Found |\n| 010405 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Many Addresses Found |\n| 010406 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Postal Code |\n| 010407 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Country Not Mapped |\n| 010408 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Recipient Name |\n| 010409 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Bad UK Address |\n| 010410 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Address Line 1 or 2 |\n| 010501 | Processing Order | Sku Problem | Invalid SKU |\n| 010501 | Processing Order | Sku Problem | Child Order has Invalid SKUs |\n| 010601 | Processing Order | Facility Problem | Facility Not Mapped |\n| 010701 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Unmapped Ship Method |\n| 010702 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Unmapped Ship Cost |\n| 010703 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Missing Ship Method |\n| 010704 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Invalid Ship Method |\n| 010705 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Order Weight Outside of Ship Method Weight |\n| 010801 | Processing Order | Inventory Problem | Insufficient Inventory In Facility |\n| 010802 | Processing Order | Inventory Problem | Issue Encountered During Inventory Adjustment |\n| 010901 | Processing Order | Released To WMS | Released |\n| 020101 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Problem | Address Issue |\n| 020102 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Problem | Postage OK, OMS Issue Occurred |\n| 020103 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Problem | Postage Void Failed |\n| 020201 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Acquired | |\n| 020301 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Voided | Postage Void Failed Gracefully |\n| 020301 | Fulfillment In Progress | Hold | Departure Hold Requested |\n| 020401 | Fulfillment In Progress | 4PL Processing | |\n| 020501 | Fulfillment In Progress | 4PL Problem | Order is Proccessable, Postage Issue Occurred |\n| 020601 | Fulfillment In Progress | Label Printed | |\n| 020701 | Fulfillment In Progress | Shipment Cubed | |\n| 020801 | Fulfillment In Progress | Picking Inventory | |\n| 020901 | Fulfillment In Progress | Label Print Verified | |\n| 021001 | Fulfillment In Progress | Passed Final Inspection | |\n| 030101 | Shipped | Fulfilled By 4PL | |\n| 030102 | Shipped | Fulfilled By 4PL | Successfully Fulfilled, OMS Encountered Issue During Processing |\n| 030201 | Shipped | Fulfilled By FDC | |\n| 040101 | Returned | Returned | |\n| 050101 | Cancelled | Cancelled | |\n| 060101 | Test | Test | Test |\n",

An example\n        of such information would be the language of text or a particular text extractor for URL resources.\n    </p>\n    <p>The supported types of analyses are:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>lemmatization</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Finds out lemmata (basic forms) of all the words in the document.\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>correction</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Performs correction (diacritization) on all the words in the document.\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>topic detection</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Determines a topic of the document, e.g. finance or sports.\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>sentiment analysis</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Determines a sentiment of the document, i.e. how positive or negative the document is.\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>named entity recognition</strong> &longrightarrow;\n            Finds named entities (like person, location, date etc.) mentioned the the document.\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Encoding</h2>\n    <p>The supplied text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, this is especially important for non-english texts.</p>\n\n    <h2>Returned values</h2>\n    <p>The API calls always return objects in serialized JSON format in UTF-8 encoding.</p>\n    <p>\n        If any error occurs, the HTTP response code will be in the range <code>4xx</code> (client-side error) or\n        <code>5xx</code> (server-side error). In this situation, the body of the response will contain information\n        about the error in JSON format, with <code>exception</code> and <code>message</code> values.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>URL limitations</h2>\n    <p>\n        All the requests are semantically <code>GET</code>. However, for longer texts, you may run into issues\n        with URL length limit. Therefore, it's possible to always issue a <code>POST</code> request with all\n        the parameters encoded as a JSON in the request body.\n    </p>\n    <p>Example:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n        POST /s1/sentiment\n        Content-Type: application/json\n\n        {\"text\":\"There is no harm in being sometimes wrong - especially if one is promptly found out.\"}\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>This is equivalent to <code>GET /s1/sentiment?text=There%20is%20no%20harm...</code></p>\n\n    <h2>Request limitations</h2>\n    <p>\n        The API has other limitations concerning the size of the HTTP requests. The maximum allowed size of any\n        POST request body is <em>512 KiB</em>. For request with a URL resource, the maximum allowed number of\n        extracted characters from each such resource is <em>100,000</em>.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>\n    <p>\n        By using the API, you agree to our\n        <a href=\"https://www.geneea.com/terms.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service Agreement</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>More information</h2>\n    <p>\n        <a href=\"https://help.geneea.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n        The Interpretor Public Documentation\n        </a>\n    </p>\n</div>\n",

    "title": "Postman API",
    "description": "The Postman API allows you to programmatically access data stored in Postman account with ease.\n\nThe easiest way to get started with the API is to click the **fork** button to fork this collection to your own workspace and use Postman to send requests.\n\n\n# Overview\n\n1. You need a valid <a href=\"#authentication\">API Key</a> to send requests to the API endpoints. You can get your key from the [integrations dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).\n\n1. The API has an access <a href=\"#rate-limits\">rate limit</a> applied to it.\n\n1. The Postman API will only respond to secured communication done over HTTPS. HTTP requests will be sent a `301` redirect to corresponding HTTPS resources.\n\n1. Response to every request is sent in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). In case the API request results in an error, it is represented by an `\"error\": {}` key in the JSON response.\n\n1. The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made using the `GET` method implies that you want to fetch something from Postman, and `POST` implies you want to save something new to Postman.\n\n1. The API calls will respond with appropriate [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for all requests. Within Postman Client, when a response is received, the status code is highlighted and is accompanied by a help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A `200 OK` indicates all went well, while `4XX` or `5XX` response codes indicate an error from the requesting client or our API servers respectively.\n\n1. Individual resources in your Postman Account is accessible using its unique id (`uid`). The `uid` is a simple concatenation of the resource owner's user-id and the resource-id. For example, a collection's `uid` is `{{owner_id}}-{{collection_id}}`.\n\n# Authentication\n\nAn API Key is required to be sent as part of every request to the Postman API, in the form of an `X-Api-Key` request header.\n\n> If you do not have an API Key, you can easily generate one by heading over to the [Postman Integrations Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/integrations/services/pm_pro_api).\n\nAn API Key tells our API server that the request it received came from you. Everything that you have access to in Postman is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.\n\nFor ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an [environment variable](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments) called `postman_api_key` and this [Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections) will automatically use it to make API calls.\n\n## API Key related error response\n\nIf an API Key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive a `401 Unauthorised` response code and the following JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\": { \n    \"name\": \"AuthenticationError\",\n    \"message\": \"API Key missing. Every request requires an API Key to be sent.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Using the API Key as a query parameter\n\nEvery request that accepts API Key as `X-Api-Key` request header, also accepts the key when sent as `apikey` URL query parameter.\n\nAPI key sent as part of the header has a higher priority in case you send the key using both request header and query parameter.\n\n\n# Rate Limits\n\nAPI access rate limits are applied at a per-key basis in unit time. Access to the API using a key is limited to **60 requests per minute**. In addition, every API response is accompanied by the following set of headers to identify the status of your consumption.\n\n\n| Header                  | Description |\n|-------------------------|-------------|\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |\n\n\nOnce you hit the rate limit, you will receive a response similar to the following JSON, with a status code of `429 Too Many Requests`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"name\": \"rateLimitError\",\n    \"message\": \"Rate Limit exceeded. Please retry at 1465452702843\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n# Support\n\nFor help regarding accessing the Postman API, feel free to discuss it in our [Discourse Community](https://community.getpostman.com). You can also drop in a line at [help@getpostman.com](mailto:help@getpostman.com).\n\nIn the event you receive a `503` response from our servers, it implies that we have hit an unexpected spike in API access traffic and would usually be operational within the next 5 minutes. If the outage persists, or your receive any other form of `5XX` error, kindly let us know.\n\n\n# Terms of Use\n\nFor information on API terms of use and privacy, refer to our terms at [http://postman.com/legal/terms/](http://postman.com/legal/terms/) and our privacy policy at [https://www.postman.com/legal/privacy-policy/](https://www.postman.com/legal/privacy-policy/).\n\n\n# API Reference",

    "description": "Since 2006, [Gisgraphy](http://www.gisgraphy.com) is a free, open source framework that offers the possibility to do geolocalisation and geocoding via Java APIs or REST webservices. Because geocoding is nothing without data, it provides an easy to use importer that will automatically download and import the necessary (free) data to your local database ([OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) and [Quattroshapes](http://www.quattroshapes.com/): more than 100 million entries). You can also add your own data with the Web interface or the importer connectors provided. Gisgraphy is production ready, and has been designed to be scalable(load balanced), performant and used in other languages than just java : results can be output in XML, JSON, PHP, Python, Ruby, YAML, GeoRSS, and Atom. One of the most popular GPS tracking System (OpenGTS) also includes a Gisgraphy client...Gisgraphy is a framework. As a result it's flexible and powerful enough to be used in a lot of different use cases.

Your requests must also use the <b>HTTPS</b> protocol.\n\nIf you don't have a token yet, you need to apply for one [here](https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/).\n\nYour personal token can be found under the <a href=\"https://www.globalwinescore.com/account/api/\" target=\"_blank\">My account > API</a> section of the GlobalWineScore website\n\n# Format\nThe API provides several rendering formats which you can control using the `Accept` header or `format` query parameter.\n\n- JSON (default): no header or `Accept: application/json`\n- XML: `Accept: application/xml`\n# Rate limiting\nFor API requests, the rate limit allows for up to 10 requests per minute.\n\n# Error handling\n\nWhether a request succeeded is indicated by the HTTP status code. A 2xx status code indicates success, whereas a 4xx status code indicates failure.\n\nWhen a request fails, the response body is still JSON, but always contains a `detail` field with a description of the error, which you can inspect for debugging.\n\nFor example, trying to access the API without proper authentication will return code 403 along with the message:\n\n`{\"detail\": \"Authentication credentials were not provided.\"}`\n\nFound a bug ? send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:api@globalwinescore.com\">api@globalwinescore.com</a>\n\n# Ordering\n\nAt the moment, GlobalWineScores may be sorted by `date` and `score`. Use \"-\"\nto sort in descending order.\n\n# Continuous synchronization\n\nIf you need to synchronize your database with our API, you can query our API using `?ordering=-date` to get the newest scores first, which means you won't have to crawl the whole catalog every time :-)\n\n# Quick search interface\nIf you need to search our catalog (e.g. to align it with yours), we're providing you with a handy interface accessible here: <a href=\"https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/</a>\n\nYou need to be logged in (email/password) to access this page, but other than that you can share it with anyone in your team and start searching right away !\n\n# Resources\n\nThe details about available endpoints can be found below.\nYou can click on each endpoint to find information about their parameters.\n",

Clean USA IPs.\n\nSimple to use API, but advance enough to support special parameters such as languages, country and geographic locality.\n\nGoogio is the ultimate search API for Google Searches, Google News, and Google SERP.\n# Docs\n\n> An Unofficial Google Search API\n\nAn API to perform Google Searches. Extremely fast and accurate. Zero proxies. Clean USA IPs.\n\nSimple to use API, but advance enough to support special parameters such as languages, country and geographic locality.\n\n# Example Code\n\n Check out [Github repo](https://github.com/googio/googio_examples) for example code for calling the API with various languages.\n\n# Authentication\n\n### API Key\n\nOptional API key for authenticated access. Note that we use \"API key\" interchangably in these docs.\n\nAuthenticated requests must include an `apikey` header containing your subscription's API Key.\n\n| Security Schema Type | Header Name | Example Token |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| API Key | `apikey` | c5bfb018-ab46-4e61-9271-4ec7e9c04a6e |\n\nIn the following example, `YOU_APIKEY` represents the auth token for your account.\n\n```\ncurl --header 'apikey: YOU_APIKEY'\n```\n\nYou can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard](/dashboard).\n\nBe sure to keep your API keys secure. Do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.\n\nAlso note that all API requests must be made over **HTTPS**. Calls made over plain HTTP will attempt to be automatically upgraded to HTTPS, though this use cases is discouraged.\n\n\n## Rate Limits\n\nAPI requests may be rate limited depending on your subscription plan and traffic patterns. The following response headers will be present in these cases:\n\n| Header | Description |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |\n\nWhen the rate limit is **exceeded**, an error is returned with the status \"**429 Too Many Requests**\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"too_many_requests\",\n    \"message\": \"Rate limit exceeded\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Errors\n\nThis API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, endpoint not found, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our API (these are rare).\n\n\n",

    "description": "# Google Home Local API\nThis is an unofficial documentation of the local API used by the Home app to communicate with GH devices.\n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi)\n\n[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi)](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi/stargazers) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi)](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nRequests must be made over HTTPS, port 8443, so the base URL for these endpoints is: `https://<google-home-ip>:8443/setup/`\n\nGet the IP of Google Home from the Google Home app (Device Settings -> End of the list) or from your router.\n\nGET requests are simple, in the browser kind.  \nPOST requests need to set the header (when there's a body): `content-type: application/json`\n\n## Authentication\n\nSince June 2019, most requests (with exceptions like `/setup/eureka_info`) need a local authorization token.\n\nThere are 3 kinds of tokens involved here:\n\n### Local Authorization Token\nThis token must be sent in all requests in the header `cast-local-authorization-token`. It is short-lived (~1 day) and may change unexpectedly (with a sync, change in homegraph, etc.)\n##### Get this token\n- With access to an android device, [get this token directly by either method](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/1a0f4937af957ef6a78453e3be482c1f).\n- Without a device, or to integrate it with a script, use an access token to get the homegraph and extract the token. To get an access token, read the next section. Check the example section for more info.\n\n### Access Token\nThis is a standard google oauth2 access token. It is in the form `ya29.***`.\nThis gives access to the Google Home Foyer API. These expire in an hour.\nUse this to get the homegraph (and then the local authorization token above).\n##### Get this token\nTo get this access token, either a Google account username/password or a Google Master Token is needed. More info in the gist.\nUse the script [from this gist](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/952f83ea656c6782fbd0f1645059055d).\n\n### Master Token\nThis is in the form `aas_et/***` and can be used to request access tokens.\n##### Get this token\nThe same [script in the gist](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/952f83ea656c6782fbd0f1645059055d) that gets the access token can also get the master token. Needs Google account creds.\n\n## Example\n\nHere's the whole flow from just a pair of username/password to using the local API.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)\n- [Proto files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RvnN3y-G23pd2SWHmfV_7sef8QU5GNF4?usp=sharing) (preserve folder structure)\n\n### 1. Get an access token with the script\n- Download get_tokens.py\n- Fill in username and password\n```sh\npython3 get_tokens.py\n# Note down the access token printed.\n```\n\n### 2. Use the access token and get home graph\n- This prints the json and uses jq to parse and filter out the fields deviceName and localAuthToken\n- This will give a list of all devices and their local auth tokens\n```sh\n./grpcurl -H 'authorization: Bearer ya29.a0Af****' \\\n\t-import-path /path/to/protos \\\n\t-proto /path/to/protos/google/internal/home/foyer/v1.proto \\\n\tgooglehomefoyer-pa.googleapis.com:443 \\\n\tgoogle.internal.home.foyer.v1.StructuresService/GetHomeGraph | jq '.home.devices[] | {deviceName, localAuthToken}'\n# Note down the local auth token for the device you want.\n```\n\n### 3. Make the call to the local device using the local auth token\n```sh\ncurl -H \"cast-local-authorization-token: LOCAL_AUTH_TOKEN\" --verbose --insecure https://192.168.0.18:8443/setup/bluetooth/status\n```",

    "description": "\nWith the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://www.graphhopper.com/products/) you can integrate A-to-B route planning, turn-by-turn navigation,\nroute optimization, isochrone calculations and other tools in your application.\n\nThe GraphHopper Directions API consists of the following RESTful web services:\n\n * [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API),\n * [Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API),\n * [Isochrone API](#tag/Isochrone-API),\n * [Map Matching API](#tag/Map-Matching-API),\n * [Matrix API](#tag/Matrix-API),\n * [Geocoding API](#tag/Geocoding-API) and\n * [Cluster API](#tag/Cluster-API).\n\n# Explore our APIs\n\n## Get started\n\n1. [Sign up for GraphHopper](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976025)\n2. [Create an API key](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976027)\n\nEach API part has its own documentation. Jump to the desired API part and learn about the API through the given examples and tutorials.\n\nIn addition, for each API there are specific sample requests that you can send via Insomnia or Postman to see what the requests and responses look like.\n\n## Insomnia\n\nTo explore our APIs with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Insomnia and Import [our workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/GraphHopper-Direction-API-Insomnia.json).\n2. Specify [your API key](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) in your workspace: Manage Environments -> Base Environment -> `\"api_key\": your API key`\n3. Start exploring\n\n![Insomnia](./img/insomnia.png)\n\n## Postman\n\nTo explore our APIs with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), follow these steps:\n\n1. Import our [request collections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/graphhopper_directions_api.postman_collection.json) as well as our [environment file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/graphhopper_directions_api.postman_environment.json).\n2. Specify [your API key](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) in your environment: `\"api_key\": your API key`\n3. Start exploring\n\n![Postman](./img/postman.png)\n\n## API Client Libraries\n\nTo speed up development and make coding easier, we offer the following client libraries:\n\n * [JavaScript client](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client) - try the [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/)\n * [Others](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-clients) like C#, Ruby, PHP, Python, ... automatically created for the Route Optimization API\n\n### Bandwidth reduction\n\nIf you create your own client, make sure it supports http/2 and gzipped responses for best speed.\n\nIf you use the Matrix, the Route Optimization API or the Cluster API and want to solve large problems, we recommend you to reduce bandwidth\nby [compressing your POST request](https://gist.github.com/karussell/82851e303ea7b3459b2dea01f18949f4)\nand specifying the header as follows: `Content-Encoding: gzip`. This will also avoid the HTTP 413 error \"Request Entity Too Large\".\n\n## Contact Us\n\nIf you have problems or questions, please read the following information:\n\n- [FAQ](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/)\n- [Public forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/directions-api)\n- [Contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/)\n- [GraphHopper Status Page](https://status.graphhopper.com/)\n\nTo stay informed about the latest developments, you can\n\n- follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/graphhopper/),\n- read [our blog](https://graphhopper.com/blog/),\n- watch [our documentation repository](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc),\n- sign up for our newsletter or\n- [our forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/directions-api).\n\nSelect the channel you like the most.\n\n\n# Map Data and Routing Profiles\n\nCurrently, our main data source is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). We also integrated other network data providers.\nThis chapter gives an overview about the options you have.\n\n## OpenStreetMap\n\n#### Geographical Coverage\n\n[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) covers the whole world. If you want to see for yourself if we can provide data suitable for your region,\nplease visit [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/).\nYou can edit and modify OpenStreetMap data if you find that important information is missing, e.g. a weight limit for a bridge.\n[Here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) is a beginner's guide that shows how to add data. If you have edited data, we usually consider your data after 1 week at the latest.\n\n#### Supported Vehicle Profiles\n\nThe Routing, Matrix and Route Optimization APIs support the following vehicle profiles:\n\nName       | Description           | Restrictions              | Icon\n-----------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------\ncar        | Car mode              | car access                | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png)\nsmall_truck| Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily | height=2.7m, width=2+0.4m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png)\ntruck      | Truck like a MAN or Mercedes-Benz Actros | height=3.7m, width=2.6+0.5m, length=12m, weight=13000 + 13000 kg, hgv=yes, 3 Axes | ![truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/truck.png)\nscooter    | Moped mode | Fast inner city, often used for food delivery, is able to ignore certain bollards, maximum speed of roughly 50km/h | ![scooter image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/scooter.png)\nfoot       | Pedestrian or walking without dangerous [SAC-scales](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:sac_scale) | foot access         | ![foot image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/foot.png)\nhike       | Pedestrian or walking with priority for more beautiful hiking tours and potentially a bit longer than `foot`. Walking duration is influenced by elevation differences.  | foot access         | ![hike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/hike.png)\nbike       | Trekking bike avoiding hills | bike access  | ![bike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/bike.png)\nmtb        | Mountainbike          | bike access         | ![Mountainbike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/mtb.png)\nracingbike| Bike preferring roads | bike access         | ![racingbike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/racingbike.png)\n\nPlease note:\n\n * all motor vehicles (`car`, `small_truck`, `truck` and `scooter`) support turn restrictions via `turn_costs=true`\n * the free package supports only the vehicle profiles `car`, `bike` or `foot`\n * up to 2 different vehicle profiles can be used in a single optimization request. The number of vehicles is unaffected and depends on your subscription.\n * we offer custom vehicle profiles with different properties, different speed profiles or different access options. To find out more about custom profiles, please [contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/).\n * a sophisticated `motorcycle` profile is available up on request. It is powered by the [Kurviger](https://kurviger.de/en) Routing API and favors curves and slopes while avoiding cities and highways.\n \n## TomTom\n\nIf you want to include traffic, you can purchase the TomTom Add-on.\nThis Add-on only uses TomTom's road network and historical traffic information.\nLive traffic is not yet considered. If you are interested to learn how we consider traffic information, we recommend that you read [this article](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2017/11/06/time-dependent-optimization/).\n\nPlease note the following:\n\n * Currently we only offer this for our [Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API).\n * In addition to our terms, you need to accept TomTom's [End User License Aggreement](https://www.graphhopper.com/tomtom-end-user-license-agreement/).\n * We do *not* use TomTom's web services. We only use their data with our software.\n \n[Contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/) for more details.\n\n#### Geographical Coverage\n\nWe offer\n\n- Europe including Russia\n- North, Central and South America\n- Saudi Arabia\n- United Arab Emirates\n- South Africa\n- Australia\n\n#### Supported Vehicle Profiles\n\nName       | Description           | Restrictions              | Icon\n-----------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------\ncar        | Car mode              | car access                | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png)\nsmall_truck| Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily | height=2.7m, width=2+0.4m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png)\n",

    "description": "This is the official API documentation for the Public Hetzner Cloud.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format. The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses.\n\nAs an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to use:\n* Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)\n* Our [library for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go)\n* Our [library for Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python)\n\nAlso you can find a [list of libraries, tools, and integrations on GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud).\n\nIf you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open Source you may be eligible for a free one time €50 (excl. VAT) credit on your account. Please contact us via the the support page on your Cloud Console and let us know the following:\n* The type of integration you would like to develop\n* Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project\n* Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have done so)\n\n## Getting Started\nTo get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the Project. Let’s say your new token is `jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX`.\n\nYou’re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).\n\nMake sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We will almost always provide a resource root like `servers` inside the example response. A response can also contain a `meta` object with information like [Pagination](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#overview-pagination).\n\n**Example Request**\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX\" \\\n    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers\n```\n\n**Example Response**\n```json\n{\n    \"servers\": [],\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"pagination\": {\n            \"page\": 1,\n            \"per_page\": 25,\n            \"previous_page\": null,\n            \"next_page\": null,\n            \"last_page\": 1,\n            \"total_entries\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Authentication\nAll requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be authenticated via a API token. Include your secret API token in every request you send to the API with the `Authorization` HTTP header.\n\nTo create a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token.\n\n**Example Authorization header**\n```html\nAuthorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj\n```\n\n## Errors\nErrors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response of the request which generated the error contains an error code, an error message, and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details object depends on the error code.\n\nThe error response contains the following keys:\n\n| Keys      | Meaning                                                               |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `code`    | Short string indicating the type of error (machine-parsable)          |\n| `message` | Textual description on what has gone wrong                            |\n| `details` | An object providing for details on the error (schema depends on code) |\n\n**Example response**\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"invalid_input\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"broken_field\",\n          \"messages\": [\"is too long\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Error Codes\n\n| Code                      | Description                                                                      |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `forbidden`               | Insufficient permissions for this request                                        |\n| `invalid_input`           | Error while parsing or processing the input                                      |\n| `json_error`              | Invalid JSON input in your request                                               |\n| `locked`                  | The item you are trying to access is locked (there is already an Action running) |\n| `not_found`               | Entity not found                                                                 |\n| `rate_limit_exceeded`     | Error when sending too many requests                                             |\n| `resource_limit_exceeded` | Error when exceeding the maximum quantity of a resource for an account           |\n| `resource_unavailable`    | The requested resource is currently unavailable                                  |\n| `service_error`           | Error within a service                                                           |\n| `uniqueness_error`        | One or more of the objects fields must be unique                                 |\n| `protected`               | The Action you are trying to start is protected for this resource                |\n| `maintenance`             | Cannot perform operation due to maintenance                                      |\n| `conflict`                | The resource has changed during the request, please retry                        |\n| `unsupported_error`       | The corresponding resource does not support the Action                           |\n| `token_readonly`          | The token is only allowed to perform GET requests                                |\n| `unavailable`             | A service or product is currently not available                                  |\n\n**invalid_input**\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"invalid_input\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"broken_field\",\n          \"messages\": [\"is too long\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**uniqueness_error**\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"uniqueness_error\",\n    \"message\": \"SSH key with the same fingerprint already exists\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"public_key\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**resource_limit_exceeded**\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"resource_limit_exceeded\",\n    \"message\": \"project limit exceeded\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"limits\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"project_limit\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Labels\nLabels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources.\n\nValid label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).\n\nValid label values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.\n\nThe `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used.\n\n**Example Labels**\n```json\n{\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"environment\":\"development\",\n    \"service\":\"backend\",\n    \"example.com/my\":\"label\",\n    \"just-a-key\":\"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Label Selector\nFor resources with labels, you can filter resources by their labels using the label selector query language.\n\n| Expression           | Meaning                                                             |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `k==v` / `k=v`       | Value of key `k` does equal value `v`                               |\n| `k!=v`               | Value of key `k` does not equal value `v`                           |\n| `k`                  | Key `k` is present                                                  |\n| `!k`                 | Key `k` is not present                                              |\n| `k in (v1,v2,v3)`    | Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`                             |\n| `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor `v2`, nor `v3`                |\n| `k1==v,!k2`          | Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is not present                |\n\n### Examples\n* Returns all resources that have a `env=production` label and that don't have a `type=database` label:\n\n  `env=production,type!=database`\n* Returns all resources that have a `env=testing` or `env=staging` label:\n\n    `env in (testing,staging)`\n* Returns all resources that don't have a `type` label:\n\n    `!type`\n\n## Pagination\nResponses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters:\n\n* A `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first page is 1.\n* A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per page. The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise specified in the documentation.\n\nResponses contain a `Link` header with pagination information.\n\nAdditionally, if the response body is JSON and the root object is an object, that object has a `pagination` object inside the `meta` object with pagination information:\n\n**Example Pagination**\n```json\n{\n    \"servers\": [...],\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"pagination\": {\n            \"page\": 2,\n            \"per_page\": 25,\n            \"previous_page\": 1,\n            \"next_page\": 3,\n            \"last_page\": 4,\n            \"total_entries\": 100\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of entries is unknown.\n\n**Example Pagination Link header**\n```bash\nLink: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel=\"prev\",\n      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel=\"next\",\n      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel=\"last\"\n```\n\nLine breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only contain some of the above `rel` values.\n\n## Rate Limiting\nAll requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses contain serveral headers which provide information about your current rate limit status.\n\n* The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can perform per hour.\n* The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining in the current rate limit time frame.\n* The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in time when your rate limit will have recovered and you will have the full number of requests available again.\n\nThe default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600 requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every second.\n\n## Server Metadata\nYour Server can discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to specific URLs. The following data is available:\n\n| Data              | Format | Contents                                                     |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| hostname          | text   | Name of the Server as set in the api                         |\n| instance-id       | number | ID of the server                                             |\n| public-ipv4       | text   | Primary public IPv4 address                                  |\n| private-networks  | yaml   | Details about the private networks the Server is attached to |\n| availability-zone | text   | Name of the availability zone that Server runs in            |\n| region            | text   | Network zone, e.g. eu-central                                |\n\n**Example: Summary**\n```bash\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata\n```\n\n```yaml\navailability-zone: hel1-dc2\nhostname: my-server\ninstance-id: 42\npublic-ipv4: 1.2.3.4\nregion: eu-central\n```\n\n**Example: Hostname**\n```bash\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/hostname\nmy-server\n```\n\n**Example: Instance ID**\n```bash\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/instance-id\n42\n```\n\n**Example: Public IPv4**\n```bash\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/public-ipv4\n1.2.3.4\n```\n\n**Example: Private Networks**\n```bash\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/private-networks\n```\n\n```json\n- ip: 10.0.0.2\n  alias_ips: [10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4]\n  interface_num: 1\n  mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e0\n  network_id: 1234\n  network_name: nw-test1\n  network: 10.0.0.0/8\n  subnet: 10.0.0.0/24\n  gateway: 10.0.0.1\n- ip: 192.168.0.2\n  alias_ips: []\n  interface_num: 2\n  mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e1\n  network_id: 4321\n  network_name: nw-test2\n  network: 192.168.0.0/16\n  subnet: 192.168.0.0/24\n  gateway: 192.168.0.1\n```\n\n**Example: Availability Zone**\n```bash\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/availability-zone\nhel1-dc2\n```\n\n**Example: Region**\n```bash\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/region\neu-central\n```\n\n## Sorting\nSome responses which return multiple items support sorting. If they do support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used for sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You can sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending `:asc` or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.\n\n**Example: Sorting**\n```bash\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc\n```\n",

    "id": "ideal-postcodes.co.uk",
    "title": "API Reference - Ideal Postcodes",
    "description": "# Getting Started\n\n## Overview\n\n### Access\n\nAll API methods are either a `GET`, `POST` or `OPTIONS` request.\n\nThe API communicates over both HTTPS and plain HTTP using IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nWe recommend using HTTPS only although HTTP is available.\n\nWe use appropriate HTTP status codes where possible to indicate the request status.\n\n### Rate Limiting\n\nEach IP address is rate limited at 30 requests per second. Tripping the rate limit will result in a 503 response.\n\nThe autocomplete API also has an additional rate limit.\n\nIf you expect to breach the limit please contact us and we can move you to an endpoint with a higher limit.\n\n### JSONP\n\n[JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) requests are supported. Include a `callback=` in your request as a query parameter. Your results return wrapped in a function designated by your request.\n\n## Authentication\n\nMost requests require an **API key** for authentication. Authenticate by passing an `api_key` as part of the query string. For example:\n\n```\napi.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/v1/autocomplete/addresses?api_key=iddqd&q=parkside\n```\n\nAlternatively, authentication can be transmitted via the `Authorization` header using the following scheme:\n\n```\nAuthorization: api_key=\"iddqd\" [other_key=\"foo\"]\n```\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis API is versioned with a simple prefix in the URL. The current version is `/v1/`. We will maintain backwards-compatibility by releasing breaking changes under a new version.\n\nPlease note that the following changes are backwards-compatible:\n\n- Adding new properties to existing API responses\n- Adding new API endpoints\n- Adding new optional request parameters to existing API endpoints\n- Changing the order of properties in existing API responses\n- Changing the autocomplete address suggestion format\n\n## Error Handling\n\nA successful lookup is accompanied with a HTTP status code of 200 and a response code of 2000 (found in the body).\n\nAn error has occurred if the HTTP status code is not 200. Errors can range from a benign 404 (resource not found) to more urgent errors (your API Key ran out of credit, failed authentication, etc).\n\n## Testing\n\nEach new account comes with a free test balance. Contact us if you need more for testing and integration.\n\n### Community Key\n\nOur documentation and demos make heavy use of our community key `iddqd`. This allows for convenient access for trialing the API.\n\nMany restrictions on this key are relaxed to allow developers make test requests. This key has a limit of 15 lookups per IP address per day as well as a daily usage cap. If you hit any limit restrictions, you can continue testing the API by creating a key of your own and using our free test methods.\n\nPlease be kind with the community key. We're trusting everyone to use it responsibly so that other developers may trial the API. Thank you!\n\n## Metadata\n\nRequests that affect your balance may be annotated with arbitrary metadata. This data is stored along with your lookup history and can be queried at a later date via the API or the dashboard. We call the ability to label your requests [tagging](https://docs.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/docs/guides/tags).\n\n# Response Codes\n\nThe API returns two indicators to help you to determine the status of each HTTP request.\n\nThe first is the **HTTP Status**, which is found in the status-line of all HTTP requests. The API will return status codes that adhere to HTTP /1.1 Specifications wherever possible.\n\n`2XX` status codes indicates success while `4XX` and `5XX` indicate client and server errors respectively.\n\nThe second is the **API response code**, which can be found in the `code` property of the response body. This code will provide a more specific reason if a failure has occurred and can point you in the right direction when debugging.\n\nPlease use the glossary of code numbers and HTTP status codes below when debugging your requests.\n\n## 200 Request Success\n\n| HTTP Code | API Code | Description                                  |\n| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| 200       | 2000     | Success.

    "description": "# Welcome\n\nImplementing a new tool can be daunting, but it doesn't have to. You can implement journy.io in a few different ways to ensure it fits with the rest of your tech stack seamlessly.\n\nWe welcome your feedback, ideas and suggestions. We really want to make your life easier, so if we’re falling short or should be doing something different, we want to hear about it. Send us an email at [hi@journy.io](mailto:hi@journy.io) or reach out via the chat on our website or on our platform.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can send us data about users and accounts. We have both frontend and backend APIs, which can be used together at the same time.\n\nIf you already use [Segment](https://segment.com/), you can [get up and running with journy.io in seconds](https://help.journy.io/en/articles/6488307-the-segment-connector).\n\n# Concepts\n\n## Users\n\nThe most basic entity is a user, a specific individual that completed an interaction with your product.\n\nWe support multiple types of users, often differentiated by it's external ID prefix. E.g. In the case you are building an ordering app, there could easily be an administrator (who updates products and checks for orders) and the end-customers who place orders. One could have a typical ADM-XXXXXXXX ID, while the other would be referenced by USR-XXXXXXXXX.\n\n## Accounts\n\nIn B2B SaaS, users can be part of multiple accounts. E.g. Imagine you're building a content scheduling app where an agency can manage the social media posts of their clients. Each client of the agency has its own account in the product.\n\nIf your app doesn't have the concept of a team or group of users, you can ignore accounts.\n\n## Events\n\nAn event is a data point that represents an interaction between a user and/or an account; and your product. Events can represents any range of interactions. E.g. Every time a customer creates an invoice in an invoicing app. Actions like creating an invoice can be tracked as an event in journy.io.\n\nIt's critical to track events properly. You'll need to provide either an account ID, or a user ID, or both; when tracking an event. E.g. If a user updates his personal settings, you can omit the account ID as the event would not be related to any account. In a same logic, an account could get a 'suspend account' event (with account ID) from an internal process, whereas no user would be associated. In most cases, events will be associated to both 1 user and 1 account.\n\nYou can optionally pass extra details as metadata (e.g. amount of the invoice). This gets particarly powerfull when creating computed properties on those event metadata. E.g. Our above ordering app could send journy.io 'Place Order' events with metadata 'price', on which journy.io very easily would compute a total order value (for each account) for the last 30 days.\n\n💡 Metadata does not update the properties of a user or account.\n\n# Frontend vs backend\n\nThe best implementations we see employ a hybrid approach to maximize data quality while maintaining the flexibility to easily collect the data they need.\n\nWe recommend using our JavaScript snippet to track screen views and our backend API to sync users, sync accounts and track events.\n\nWhen evaluating how to track a particular event, we suggest starting with server-side and only use frontend if it's not possible to collect purely server-side. This can be the case if you need to track interactions with your product that don't result in any natural server requests (such as a button click that opens a modal).\n\n# Frontend\n\n## Setup\n\n💡 You can find the JavaScript snippet in the website settings in the connections view.\n\nCopy the JavaScript snippet and place it in the head or body of your application.\n\nThe snippet automatically calls `journy(\"init\", { ... })` and `journy(\"pageview\")`.\n\n## Identify user\n\n💡 A user ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize a user by in your own systems. Because these IDs are consistent across a customer’s lifetime, you should include a user ID in identify calls as often as you can. Ideally, the user ID should be a database ID.\n\n💡 journy.io does not recommend using simple email addresses or usernames as user ID, as these can change over time. journy.io recommends that you use static IDs instead, so the IDs never change. When you use a static ID, you can still recognize the user in your analytics tools, even if the user changes their email address.\n\n💡 The properties `full_name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone` and `registered_at` will be used for creating contacts in destinations like Intercom, HubSpot, Salesforce, ...\n\n`journy(\"identify\")` allows you to identify the user that is currently using your product.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"identify\", {\n  // Email or user ID is required\n  email: \"john.doe@acme.com\",\n  // Unique identifier for the user in your database\n  userId: \"20\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the user ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n\n  // Optional\n  properties: {\n    full_name: \"John Doe\",\n    // or\n    first_name: \"John\",\n    last_name: \"Doe\",\n\n    phone: \"123\",\n    registered_at: new Date(/* ... */),\n    is_admin: true,\n    key_with_empty_value: \"\",\n    this_property_will_be_deleted: null,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Identify account\n\n💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.\n\n💡 The properties `name`, `mrr`, `plan` and `registered_at` will be used to create companies in destinations like Intercom, HubSpot, Salesforce, ...\n\n`journy(\"account\")` allows you to identify the business account (i.e. organization) using your product.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"account\", {\n  // Required\n  // Unique identifier for the account in your database\n  accountId: \"30\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n\n  // Optional\n  properties: {\n    name: \"ACME, Inc\",\n    mrr: 399,\n    plan: \"Pro\",\n    registered_at: new Date(/* ... */),\n    is_paying: true,\n    key_with_empty_value: \"\",\n    this_property_will_be_deleted: null,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Send page view\n\n💡 In applications, we advise you to use screen views instead of page views.\n\nThe JavaScript snippet in the site settings includes a `pageview` by default.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"pageview\");\n```\n\nIf you have a B2B application, we recommend to set account ID for every page view that happens within the context of an account.\n\n💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"pageview\", {\n  accountId: \"30\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n});\n```\n\n## Send screen view\n\nIn applications, we strongly advise you to use screen views instead of page views.\n\nPage URLs in applications often include the account ID (e.g. https://app.acme.com/accountId/settings).\n\nThis makes it difficult to create signals, segments, ... based on those URLs.\n\nThat's what screen views solve. It allows you to set a name for the screen being viewed (e.g. Account settings).\n\n```ts\njourny(\"screen\", { name: \"Personal settings\" });\n```\n\nIf you have a B2B application, we recommend to set account ID for every screen view that happens within the context of an account.\n\nExample: \"Personal settings\" would be without account ID, \"Team settings\" would be with account ID.\n\n💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"screen\", {\n  name: \"Account settings\",\n  accountId: \"30\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n});\n```\n\n## Trigger an event\n\n💡 Use past tense for event names.\n\nUser events:\n\n```js\njourny(\"event\", {\n  // required\n  name: \"signed_in\",\n\n  // optional\n  metadata: {\n    key: \"value\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nAccount events:\n\n💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.\n\n```js\njourny(\"event\", {\n  // required\n  name: \"created_invoice\",\n  accountId: \"30\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n\n  // optional\n  metadata: {\n    key: \"value\",\n    amount: 100,\n    allow_wire_transfer: true,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Identity verification\n\nIdentity verification ensures that one person can't impersonate another.\n\nIdentity verification requires you to add an hash (HMAC) (that you generate on your server using SHA256) to your installation snippet alongside your user ID and account ID.\n\njourny.io won't accept requests for a logged-in user without a valid hash. The hash is calculated using a secret key, which you should never share. Without this secret key, no third party can send journy.io a valid hash for one of your users, so they can't impersonate your users.\n\nThis is optional but highly recommended.\n\nYou can enable identify verification in the website settings in the connections view.\n\n```js\njourny(\"identify\", {\n  userId: \"userId\",\n  verification: \"USER_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE\"\n})\n\njourny(\"account\", {\n  accountId: \"accountId\",\n  verification: \"ACCOUNT_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE\"\n})\n\njourny(\"event\", {\n  accountId: \"accountId\",\n  verification: \"ACCOUNT_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE\"\n})\n```\n\n### PHP\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nhash_hmac(\n  'sha256', // hash function\n  id, // user or account ID\n  'secret' // secret key (keep safe!)\n);\n```\n\n### Node.js\n\n```js\nimport { createHmac } from \"crypto\"\n\ncreateHmac(\n  \"sha256\", // hash function\n  'secret' // secret key (keep safe!)\n).update(id).digest(\"hex\") // user or account ID\n```\n\n### Ruby\n\n```ruby\nOpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(\n  'sha256', # hash function\n  'secret', # secret key (keep safe!)\n  id.to_s # user or account ID\n)\n```\n\n### Python\n\n```\nimport hmac\nimport hashlib\n\nhmac.new(\n  b'secret', # secret key (keep safe!)\n  bytes(id, encoding='utf-8'), # user or account ID\n  digestmod=hashlib.sha256 # hash function\n).hexdigest()\n```\n\n## Single page application\n\nYou can use our JavaScript snippet inside single page applications.\n\nYou should call `journy(\"screen\")` (or `journy(\"pageview\")`) whenever a user in your application transitions to another page. You can do this by listening to router change events. The current page URL will always be resolved using `window.location.href`.\n\nYou can trigger events using `journy(\"event\")` whenever you need to.\n\n### Next.js\n\nWe built a demo app with Next.js. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk-demo-app).\n\nThis [component](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk-demo-app/blob/main/components/Journy.js) should be a great start.\n\nYou can use the `Script` component from Next.js to load the web snippet and call `init`.\n\nDon't forget to listen on route changes. You can use the `useRouter` hook for that.\n\n### React Router v6\n\nYou can use the [`useLocation`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/api#uselocation) hook to listen for route changes:\n\n```js\nimport React, { useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const location = useLocation();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    journy(\"screen\", { name: \"name\" });\n    // or\n    journy(\"pageview\");\n  }, [location]);\n\n  return (\n      // ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Vue Router\n\nYou can use [`router.afterEach`](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#global-after-hooks) to listen for route changes:\n\n```js\nconst router = new VueRouter({ ... });\n\nrouter.afterEach((to, from) => {\n  journy(\"screen\", { name: \"name\" });\n  // or\n  journy(\"pageview\");\n});\n```\n\nNote: We don't accept a page URL argument for `journy(\"pageview\")`. The current page URL will always be resolved using `window.location.href`.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nWe published an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journyio/web-types) with type definitions to enable type-safe usage of our JavaScript snippet. The code and documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/journy-io/web-types).\n\n## Localhost\n\nBy default a site doesn't allow page views from other domains than the registered domain. This makes it difficult to test your tracking implementation locally.\n\nYou can enable \"Allow any domain\" in the site settings to disable the domain check.\n\nThis will allow you to test the JavaScript snippet with localhost as hostname.\n\n# Backend\n\nThe journy.io API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.\n\nThe API is hosted on api.journy.io.\n\n## Official SDKs\n\nOur SDKs are designed to help you interact with our APIs with less friction. They are written in several different languages and help bridge the gap between your application and journy.io APIs. They take away the need to know the exact URL and HTTP method to use for each API call among other things leaving you more time to focus on making your application.\n\n| Language   | Package                                                                        | Source code                                                                |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 💚 Node.js | [npm install @journyio/sdk ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journyio/sdk)      | [github.com/journy-io/js-sdk](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk)         |\n| 🐘 PHP     | [composer require journy-io/sdk](https://packagist.org/packages/journy-io/sdk) | [github.com/journy-io/php-sdk](https://github.com/journy-io/php-sdk)       |\n| 🐍 Python  | [pip install journyio-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/journyio-sdk/)             | [github.com/journy-io/python-sdk](https://github.com/journy-io/python-sdk) |\n| 💎 Ruby    | Coming soon                                                                    | Coming soon                                                                |\n\nYour favourite programming language not included? [Let us know!](mailto:hi@journy.io)\n\nIn the meanwhile, you can use [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to generate a client for your programming language.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe journy.io API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [connections screen](https://system.journy.io).\n\nYour API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.\n\nAll API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.\n\nFor every request send to the API we expect a header `X-Api-Key` to be set with the API Key.\n\n## Permissions\n\nWhen creating an API Key in [the application](https://system.journy.io) you will have the choice to give permissions to an API Key (which you can change later on). These permissions restrict the API Key from different actions. When an API Key tries to perform a certain action it doesn't have the permissions for, you will receive a `401: Unauthorized` response.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nTo prevent abuse of the API there is a maximum throughput of 1800 requests per minute. If you need a higher throughput, please contact us.\n\nTo keep our platform healthy and stable, we'll block API keys that consistently hit our rate limits. Therefore, please consider taking this throughput into account.\n\nIn every response the headers `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` will be set. The `X-RateLimit-Limit`-header will always contain the current limit of requests per minute. The `X-RateLimit-Remaining`-header will always contain the amount of requests you have left in the current sliding window.\n\n💡 The client-side tracking uses different rate limits.\n\n## Errors\n\njourny.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g. a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with journy.io's servers (these are rare).\n\nWhen performing a `POST`- or `PUT`-request with a requestBody, or when including parameters, these parameters and fields will automatically be checked and validated against the API Spec. When any error occurs, you will get a response with an `errors`-field, structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"errors\": {\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"header\": {\n        \"headerParameterName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the header parameter.\",\n        ...\n      },\n      \"query\": {\n        \"queryParameterName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the query parameter.\",\n        ...\n      },\n      \"path\": {\n        \"pathParameterName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the path parameter.\",\n        ...\n      },\n    },\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"fieldName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the fieldName.\",\n      \"object.fieldName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the fieldName of the included object.\",\n       ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Track accounts & users immediately on creation\n\nWhen you create an account in your database, immediately sending data about that account to journy.io helps your team stay in sync. The same goes for users. Call [Upsert account](#operation/upsertAccount) as soon as possible, right after the account is first created in your database.\n\n### Update account data daily\n\nNot every account is active every day. But, you may have properties on the account that change through background processing. That's why we recommend updating every one of your accounts' data in a recurring daily process. This way, you know that your accounts are updated every day in journy.io.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### December 2021\n\n[POST /events](#operation/trackJourneyEvent) will be moved to [POST /track](#operation/trackEvent). [POST /events](#operation/trackJourneyEvent) is deprecated and will be removed in the future.",

The auth token of the user can be reset on the same page.\n\n![Store Login](/images/support/api/apilogin.png)\n\nThe auth token is a **32 characters** string.\n\nIf you are developing a Jumpseller App, the authentication should be done using [OAuth-2](/support/oauth-2). Please read the article [Build an App](/support/apps) for more information.\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# Curl Examples\n\nTo request all the products at your store, you would append the products index path to the base url to create an URL with the format:  \n\n```text\nhttps://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX\n```\n\nIn curl, you can invoque that URL with:  \n\n```text\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX\"\n```\n\nTo create a product, you will include the JSON data and specify the MIME Type:  \n\n```text\ncurl -X POST -d '{ \"product\" : {\"name\": \"My new Product!\", \"price\": 100} }' \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\nand to update the product identified with 123:  \n\n```text\ncurl -X PUT -d '{ \"product\" : {\"name\": \"My updated Product!\", \"price\": 99} }' \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products/123.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\nor delete it:  \n\n```text\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products/123.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# PHP Examples\n\nCreate a new Product (POST method)\n\n```php\n$url = 'https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX;\n$ch = curl_init($url);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-Type: application/json'));\n\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, \"POST\"); //post method\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, '{ \"product\" : {\"name\": \"My updated Product!\", \"price\": 99} }');\n\n$result = curl_exec($ch);\nprint_r($result);\ncurl_close($ch);\n```\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# Plain JSON only. No XML.\n\n* We only support JSON for data serialization.\n* Our node format has no root element.  \n* We use snake_case to describe attribute keys (like \"created_at\").  \n* All empty value are replaced with **null** strings.\n* All API URLs end in .json to indicate that they accept and return JSON.\n* POST and PUT methods require you to explicitly state the MIME type of your request's body content as **\"application/json\"**.\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# Rate Limit\nYou can perform a maximum of:\n\n+ 240 (two hundred forty) requests per minute and\n+ 8 (eight) requests per second \n\nIf you exceed this limit, you'll get a 403 Forbidden (Rate Limit Exceeded) response for subsequent requests.  \n\nThe rate limits apply by IP address and by store. This means that multiple requests on different stores are not counted towards the same rate limit.\n\nThis limits are necessary to ensure resources are correctly used. Your application should be aware of this limits and retry any unsuccessful request, check the following Ruby stub:\n\n```ruby\ntries = 0; max_tries = 3;\nbegin\n  HTTParty.send(method, uri) # perform an API call.\n  sleep 0.5\n  tries += 1\nrescue\n  unless tries >= max_tries\n    sleep 1.0 # wait the necessary time before retrying the call again.\n    retry\n  end\nend\n```\n\nFinally, you can review the Response Headers of each request:\n\n```text\nJumpseller-PerMinuteRateLimit-Limit: 60  \nJumpseller-PerMinuteRateLimit-Remaining: 59 # requests available on the per-second interval  \nJumpseller-PerSecondRateLimit-Limit: 2  \nJumpseller-PerSecondRateLimit-Remaining: 1 # requests available on the per-second interval\n``` \n\nto better model your application requests intervals.\n\nIn the event of getting your IP banned, the Response Header `Jumpseller-BannedByRateLimit-Reset` informs you the time when will your ban be reseted.\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# Pagination\n\nBy default we will return 50 objects (products, orders, etc) per page. There is a maximum of 100, using a query string `&limit=100`.\nIf the result set gets paginated it is your responsibility to check the next page for more objects -- you do this by using query strings `&page=2`, `&page=3` and so on.\n\n```text\nhttps://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX&page=3&limit=100\n```\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# More\n* [Jumpseller API wrapper](https://gitlab.com/jumpseller-api/ruby) provides a public Ruby abstraction over our API;\n* [Apps Page](/apps) showcases external integrations with Jumpseller done by technical experts;\n* [Imgbb API](https://api.imgbb.com/) provides an easy way to upload and temporaly host for images and files.\n<br/><br/>\n***\n<br/><br/>\n",

    "description": "# Just Eat API\nJust Eat offers services for our various business partners and our consumer applications.\nHow you interact with the API depends on the services you wish to interact with.\n## Security\n### HTTPS\nAll api calls and callbacks require HTTPS. Your service will need a valid SSL certificate and be accessible via the standard SSL port (port 443).\n## Making an API request\nSome API calls require an API key, to authenticate the partner calling the API.\n```\nPUT https://uk-partnerapi.just-eat.io/orders/abcd1234 HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: JE-API-KEY abcd123456789\n```\nOther calls require a user token in the form of a JWT.\n```\nGET https://uk.api.just-eat.io/consumer/me/orders/uk HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer abcd123456789\n```\n\n## Date Formats\n### Date and time formats\nAll dates and times should use the [ISO 8601 standard for representation of dates and times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).\n\n#### For instance:\n* DueDateWithUtcOffset: `\"2015-05-26T14:52:35.5444292+01:00\"`\n  - Local time: `14:52`\n  - UTC time: `13:52`\n  - UTC offset: `+1hr` (due to daylight time saving)\n* DueDateWithUtcOffset: `\"2015-02-03T11:10:00.0000000+00:00\"`\n  - Local time: `11:10`\n  - UTC time: `11:10`\n  - UTC offset: `0` (no daylight time saving, local time is equivalent to UTC)\n\nNote that the offset may be for a timezone different to your own, so you should alway convert to your own local time for display purposes (e.g. on receipts and terminals).\n\n### Callback timestamps\nTimestamps sent to Just Eat should be recorded as the current local time (including any changes needed to account for daylight saving) with an accompanying offset that shows the difference between the recorded local time and the current UTC time.\n\nIf it is not possible to record timestamps in local time, timestamps may be recorded in UTC time with a 00:00 offset.\n## Async Webhooks\nSome of the webhooks on the platform are configured as being 'async' webhooks. These are for long-running operations, and work as follows:\n  1. Your webhook is invoked with a `?callback={returnUrl}` query string parameter. The `returnUrl` is a unique URL that you will need to send the async response to.\n  2. Return an immediate `202 Accepted` response from the webhook endpoint, to indicate that you have received the request.\n  3. Perform the long-running operation.

To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.\n\n\n# Authentication\nHTTP requests to the REST API are protected with [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). You will use the email address of your link.fish account as the username and your API access token as the password for HTTP Basic authentication.\n\nIf you do not have an account yet, go to [https://link.fish/api](https://link.fish/api) and create one first.\n\nYou will receive the API access token automatically via email after you signed up. To generate a new token and invalidate the current one log into your link.fish  account at [https://app.link.fish](https://app.link.fish) and go to: \"Plugins\" -> \"API Dashboard\"\n\nThere you can also see how many credits you used already.\n\n\n# Errors\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:\n```\n{\n\n  \"status\": {HTTP STATUS CODE}\n  \"message\": \"{ERROR MESSAGE}\"\n}\n```\nLike for example when the authorization is not provided or wrong:\n```\n{\n\n  \"status\": 401\n  \"message\": \"Unauthorized\"\n}\n```\n\n# Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find it in the response headers, under X-LF-Request-Id. In case you have problems please provide this identifier that we can help you as good and fast as possible.\n\n\nExample:\n```\nX-LF-Request-Id: f7f0036f-5277-421a-b143-f7a151571d18\n```\n\n\n# Item format\n\nThe data is by default deeply nested. So if it should be checked if there is an offer with a price, the whole tree has to be checked. To make that simpler, it is also possible to return the data \"flat\". If selected it will flatten the tree by copying all the data to the main level under a property with the name of its type and link the data internally.\n\nInformation: We created a node module which allows converting between the two formats. It did not get open sourced yet. If you are in need, simply contact us via api@link.fish.\n\n\n# Response Content Type\nBy default, all data gets returned as JSON. If the data should be returned as XML add the following header:\n\n```\nAccept: application/xml\n```\n\n# Credits\n\nDepending on the request made a different amount of credits get charged. How many which request costs can be found on the [API pricing page](http://link.fish/api/#pricing). Additionally, does a  header named \"X-LF-Credits-Charged\" get added to each successful response with information about the credits.\n\nExample:\n```\nX-LF-Credits-Charged: 1 # Credits used for current requests\nX-LF-Credits-Subscription-Max: 1000 # Total credits available in subscription\nX-LF-Credits-Subscription-Used: 512 # Credits still left in current month\n```\nYou can check anytime how many credits you did use already by logging into your link.fish  account at [https://app.link.fish](https://app.link.fish) and checking under:  \"Plugins\" -> \"API Dashboard\"\n\n\nIf you have problems, questions or improvement advice please send us an email to api@link.fish\n",

Each endpoint includes descriptions, request syntax, and\nexamples using standard HTTP requests. Response data is returned in JSON\nformat.\n\n\nThis document was generated from our OpenAPI Specification.  See the\n<a target=\"_top\" href=\"https://www.openapis.org\">OpenAPI website</a> for more information.\n\n<a target=\"_top\" href=\"/docs/api/openapi.yaml\">Download the Linode OpenAPI Specification</a>.\n\n\n## Changelog\n\n<a target=\"_top\" href=\"/docs/products/tools/api/release-notes/\">View our Changelog</a> to see release\nnotes on all changes made to our API.\n\n## Access and Authentication\n\nSome endpoints are publicly accessible without requiring authentication.\nAll endpoints affecting your Account, however, require either a Personal\nAccess Token or OAuth authentication (when using third-party\napplications).\n\n### Personal Access Token\n\nThe easiest way to access the API is with a Personal Access Token (PAT)\ngenerated from the\n<a target=\"_top\" href=\"https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens\">Linode Cloud Manager</a> or\nthe [Create Personal Access Token](/docs/api/profile/#personal-access-token-create) endpoint.\n\nAll scopes for the OAuth security model ([defined below](/docs/api/profile/#oauth)) apply to this\nsecurity model as well.\n\n#### Authentication\n\n| Security Scheme Type: | HTTP |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| **HTTP Authorization Scheme** | bearer |\n\n### OAuth\nIf you only need to access the Linode API for personal use,\nwe recommend that you create a [personal access token](/docs/api/#personal-access-token).\nIf you're designing an application that can authenticate with an arbitrary Linode user, then\nyou should use the OAuth 2.0 workflows presented in this section.\n\nFor a more detailed example of an OAuth 2.0 implementation, see our guide on [How to Create an OAuth App with the Linode Python API Library](/docs/products/tools/api/guides/create-an-oauth-app-with-the-python-api-library/#oauth-2-authentication-exchange).\n\nBefore you implement OAuth in your application, you first need to create an OAuth client. You can do this [with the Linode API](/docs/api/account/#oauth-client-create) or [via the Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/clients):\n\n  - When creating the client, you'll supply a `label` and a `redirect_uri` (referred to as the Callback URL in the Cloud Manager).\n  - The response from this endpoint will give you a `client_id` and a `secret`.\n  - Clients can be public or private, and are private by default. You can choose to make the client public when it is created.\n    - A private client is used with applications which can securely store the client secret (that is, the secret returned to you when you first created the client). For example, an application running on a secured server that only the developer has access to would use a private OAuth client. This is also called a confidential client in some OAuth documentation.\n    - A public client is used with applications where the client secret is not guaranteed to be secure. For example, a native app running on a user's computer may not be able to keep the client secret safe, as a user could potentially inspect the source of the application. So, native apps or apps that run in a user's browser should use a public client.\n    - Public and private clients follow different workflows, as described below.\n\n#### OAuth Workflow\n\nThe OAuth workflow is a series of exchanges between your third-party app and Linode. The workflow is used\nto authenticate a user before an application can start making API calls on the user's behalf.\n\nNotes:\n\n- With respect to the diagram in [section 1.2 of RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.2), login.linode.com (referred to in this section as the *login server*)\nis the Resource Owner and the Authorization Server; api.linode.com (referred to here as the *api server*) is the Resource Server.\n- The OAuth spec refers to the private and public workflows listed below as the [authorization code flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) and [implicit flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2).\n\n| PRIVATE WORKFLOW | PUBLIC WORKFLOW |\n|------------------|------------------|\n| 1.  The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. | 1.  The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. |\n| 2.  Your application then redirects the user to Linode's [login server](https://login.linode.com) with the client application's `client_id` and requested OAuth `scope`, which should appear in the URL of the login page. | 2.  Your application then redirects the user to Linode's [login server](https://login.linode.com) with the client application's `client_id` and requested OAuth `scope`, which should appear in the URL of the login page. |\n| 3.  The user logs into the login server with their username and password. | 3.  The user logs into the login server with their username and password. |\n| 4.  The login server redirects the user to the specificed redirect URL with a temporary authorization `code` (exchange code) in the URL. | 4.  The login server redirects the user back to your application with an OAuth `access_token` embedded in the redirect URL's hash. This is temporary and expires in two hours. No `refresh_token` is issued. Therefore, once the `access_token` expires, a new one will need to be issued by having the user log in again. |\n| 5.  The application issues a POST request (*see additional details below*) to the login server with the exchange code, `client_id`, and the client application's `client_secret`. | |\n| 6.  The login server responds to the client application with a new OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token`. The `access_token` is set to expire in two hours. | |\n| 7.  The `refresh_token` can be used by contacting the login server with the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `grant_type`, and `refresh_token` to get a new OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token`. The new `access_token` is good for another two hours, and the new `refresh_token` can be used to extend the session again by this same method (*see additional details below*). | |\n\n#### OAuth Private Workflow - Additional Details\n\nThe following information expands on steps 5 through 7 of the private workflow:\n\nOnce the user has logged into Linode and you have received an exchange code,\nyou will need to trade that exchange code for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`. You\ndo this by making an HTTP POST request to the following address:\n\n```\nhttps://login.linode.com/oauth/token\n```\n\nMake this request as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or as\n`multipart/form-data` and include the following parameters in the POST body:\n\n| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| client_id | Your app's client ID. |\n| client_secret | Your app's client secret. |\n| code | The code you just received from the redirect. |\n\nYou'll get a response like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scope\": \"linodes:read_write\",\n  \"access_token\": \"03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"f2ec9712e616fdb5a2a21aa0e88cfadea7502ebc62cf5bd758dbcd65e1803bad\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"expires_in\": 7200\n}\n```\n\nIncluded in the response is an `access_token`. With this token, you can proceed to make\nauthenticated HTTP requests to the API by adding this header to each request:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer 03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c\n```\n\nThis `access_token` is set to expire in two hours. To refresh access prior to expiration, make another request to the same URL with the following parameters in the POST body:\n\n| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| grant_type | The grant type you're using. Use \"refresh_token\" when refreshing access. |\n| client_id | Your app's client ID. |\n| client_secret | Your app's client secret. |\n| refresh_token | The `refresh_token` received from the previous response. |\n\nYou'll get another response with an updated `access_token` and `refresh_token`, which can then be used to refresh access again.\n\n#### OAuth Reference\n\n| Security Scheme Type | OAuth 2.0 |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| **Authorization URL** | https://login.linode.com/oauth/authorize |\n| **Token URL** | https://login.linode.com/oauth/token |\n| **Scopes** | <ul><li>`account:read_only` - Allows access to GET information about your Account.</li><li>`account:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Account.</li><li>`databases:read_only` - Allows access to GET Managed Databases on your Account.</li><li>`databases:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Managed Databases.</li><li>`domains:read_only` - Allows access to GET Domains on your Account.</li><li>`domains:read_write` - Allows access to all Domain endpoints.</li><li>`events:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Events.</li><li>`events:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Events.</li><li>`firewall:read_only` - Allows access to GET information about your Firewalls.</li><li>`firewall:read_write` - Allows access to all Firewall endpoints.</li><li>`images:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Images.</li><li>`images:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Images.</li><li>`ips:read_only` - Allows access to GET your ips.</li><li>`ips:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your ips.</li><li>`linodes:read_only` - Allows access to GET Linodes on your Account.</li><li>`linodes:read_write` - Allow access to all endpoints related to your Linodes.</li><li>`lke:read_only` - Allows access to GET LKE Clusters on your Account.</li><li>`lke:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to LKE Clusters on your Account.</li><li>`longview:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Longview Clients.</li><li>`longview:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Longview Clients.</li><li>`nodebalancers:read_only` - Allows access to GET NodeBalancers on your Account.</li><li>`nodebalancers:read_write` - Allows access to all NodeBalancer endpoints.</li><li>`object_storage:read_only` - Allows access to GET information related to your Object Storage.</li><li>`object_storage:read_write` - Allows access to all Object Storage endpoints.</li><li>`stackscripts:read_only` - Allows access to GET your StackScripts.</li><li>`stackscripts:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your StackScripts.</li><li>`volumes:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Volumes.</li><li>`volumes:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Volumes.</li></ul><br/>|\n\n## Requests\n\nRequests must be made over HTTPS to ensure transactions are encrypted. The\nfollowing Request methods are supported:\n\n| METHOD | USAGE |\n|--------|-------|\n| GET    | Retrieves data about collections and individual resources. |\n| POST   | For collections, creates a new resource of that type. Also used to perform actions on action endpoints. |\n| PUT    | Updates an existing resource. |\n| DELETE | Deletes a resource. This is a destructive action. |\n\n\n## Responses\n\nActions will return one following HTTP response status codes:\n\n| STATUS  | DESCRIPTION |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 200 OK  | The request was successful. |\n| 202 Accepted | The request was successful, but processing has not been completed. The response body includes a \"warnings\" array containing the details of incomplete processes. |\n| 204 No Content | The server successfully fulfilled the request and there is no additional content to send. |\n| 299 Deprecated | The request was successful, but involved a deprecated endpoint. The response body includes a \"warnings\" array containing warning messages. |\n| 400 Bad Request | You submitted an invalid request (missing parameters, etc.). |\n| 401 Unauthorized | You failed to authenticate for this resource. |\n| 403 Forbidden | You are authenticated, but don't have permission to do this. |\n| 404 Not Found | The resource you're requesting does not exist. |\n| 429 Too Many Requests | You've hit a rate limit. |\n| 500 Internal Server Error | Please [open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open). |\n\n## Errors\n\nSuccess is indicated via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\" target=\"_top\">Standard HTTP status codes</a>.\n`2xx` codes indicate success, `4xx` codes indicate a request error, and\n`5xx` errors indicate a server error. A\nrequest error might be an invalid input, a required parameter being omitted,\nor a malformed request. A server error means something went wrong processing\nyour request. If this occurs, please\n[open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)\nand let us know. Though errors are logged and we work quickly to resolve issues,\nopening a ticket and providing us with reproducable steps and data is always helpful.\n\nThe `errors` field is an array of the things that went wrong with your request.\nWe will try to include as many of the problems in the response as possible,\nbut it's conceivable that fixing these errors and resubmitting may result in\nnew errors coming back once we are able to get further along in the process\nof handling your request.\n\n\nWithin each error object, the `field` parameter will be included if the error\npertains to a specific field in the JSON you've submitted. This will be\nomitted if there is no relevant field. The `reason` is a human-readable\nexplanation of the error, and will always be included.\n\n## Pagination\n\nResource lists are always paginated. The response will look similar to this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": [ ... ],\n    \"page\": 1,\n    \"pages\": 3,\n    \"results\": 300\n}\n```\n\n* Pages start at 1. You may retrieve a specific page of results by adding\n`?page=x` to your URL (for example, `?page=4`). If the value of `page`\nexceeds `2^64/page_size`, the last possible page will be returned.\n\n\n* Page sizes default to 100,\nand can be set to return between 25 and 500. Page size can be set using\n`?page_size=x`.\n\n## Filtering and Sorting\n\nCollections are searchable by fields they include, marked in the spec as\n`x-linode-filterable: true`. Filters are passed\nin the `X-Filter` header and are formatted as JSON objects. Here is a request\ncall for Linode Types in our \"standard\" class:\n\n```Shell\ncurl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H 'X-Filter: { \"class\": \"standard\" }'\n```\n\nThe filter object's keys are the keys of the object you're filtering,\nand the values are accepted values. You can add multiple filters by\nincluding more than one key. For example, filtering for \"standard\" Linode\nTypes that offer one vcpu:\n\n```Shell\n curl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H 'X-Filter: { \"class\": \"standard\", \"vcpus\": 1 }'\n```\n\nIn the above example, both filters are combined with an \"and\" operation.\nHowever, if you wanted either Types with one vcpu or Types in our \"standard\"\nclass, you can add an operator:\n\n ```Shell\ncurl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H 'X-Filter: { \"+or\": [ { \"vcpus\": 1 }, { \"class\": \"standard\" } ] }'\n```\n\nEach filter in the `+or` array is its own filter object, and all conditions\nin it are combined with an \"and\" operation as they were in the previous example.\n\nOther operators are also available. Operators are keys of a Filter JSON\nobject. Their value must be of the appropriate type, and they are evaluated\nas described below:\n\n| OPERATOR | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                       |\n|----------|--------|-----------------------------------|\n| +and     | array  | All conditions must be true.       |\n| +or      | array  | One condition must be true.        |\n| +gt      | number | Value must be greater than number. |\n| +gte     | number | Value must be greater than or equal to number. |\n| +lt      | number | Value must be less than number. |\n| +lte     | number | Value must be less than or equal to number. |\n| +contains | string | Given string must be in the value. |\n| +neq      | string | Does not equal the value.          |\n| +order_by | string | Attribute to order the results by - must be filterable. |\n| +order    | string | Either \"asc\" or \"desc\". Defaults to \"asc\". Requires `+order_by`. |\n\nFor example, filtering for [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/)\nthat offer memory equal to or higher than 61440:\n\n```Shell\ncurl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H '\n    X-Filter: {\n      \"memory\": {\n        \"+gte\": 61440\n      }\n    }'\n```\n\nYou can combine and nest operators to construct arbitrarily-complex queries.\nFor example, give me all [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/)\nwhich are either `standard` or `highmem` class, or\nhave between 12 and 20 vcpus:\n\n```Shell\ncurl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n  -H '\n    X-Filter: {\n      \"+or\": [\n        {\n          \"+or\": [\n            {\n              \"class\": \"standard\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"class\": \"highmem\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"+and\": [\n            {\n              \"vcpus\": {\n                \"+gte\": 12\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"vcpus\": {\n                \"+lte\": 20\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }'\n```\n## Time Values\n\nAll times returned by the API are in UTC, regardless of the timezone configured within your user's profile (see `timezone` property within [Profile View](/docs/api/profile/#profile-view__responses)).\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nRate limits on API requests help maintain the health and stability of the Linode API. Accordingly, every endpoint of the Linode API applies a rate limit on a per user basis as determined by OAuth token for authenticated requests or IP address for public endpoints.\n\nEach rate limit consists of a total number of requests and a time window. For example, if an endpoint has a rate limit of 800 requests per minute, then up to 800 requests over a one minute window are permitted. Subsequent requests to an endpoint after hitting a rate limit return a 429 error. You can successfully remake requests to that endpoint after the rate limit window resets.\n\n### Linode APIv4 Rate Limits\n\nWith the Linode API, you can generally make up to 1,600 general API requests every two minutes. Additionally, all endpoints have a rate limit of 800 requests per minute unless otherwise specified below.\n\n**Note:** There may be rate limiting applied at other levels outside of the API, for example, at the load balancer.\n\nCreating Linodes has a dedicated rate limit of 10 requests per 30 seconds. That endpoint is:\n\n* [Linode Create](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create)\n\n`/stats` endpoints have their own dedicated rate limits of 100 requests per minute. These endpoints are:\n\n* [View Linode Statistics](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-statistics-view)\n* [View Linode Statistics (year/month)](/docs/api/linode-instances/#statistics-yearmonth-view)\n* [View NodeBalancer Statistics](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#nodebalancer-statistics-view)\n* [List Managed Stats](/docs/api/managed/#managed-stats-list)\n\nObject Storage endpoints have a dedicated rate limit of 750 requests per second. The Object Storage endpoints are:\n\n* [Object Storage Endpoints](/docs/api/object-storage/)\n\nOpening Support Tickets has a dedicated rate limit of 2 requests per minute. That endpoint is:\n\n* [Open Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)\n\nAccepting Service Transfers has a dedicated rate limit of 2 requests per minute. That endpoint is:\n\n* [Service Transfer Accept](/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-accept)\n\n### Rate Limit HTTP Response Headers\n\nThe Linode API includes the following HTTP response headers which are designed to help you avoid hitting rate limits that might disrupt your applications:\n\n* **X-RateLimit-Limit**: The maximum number of permitted requests during the rate limit window for this endpoint.\n* **X-RateLimit-Remaining**: The remaining number of permitted requests in the current rate limit window.\n* **X-RateLimit-Reset**: The time when the current rate limit window rests in UTC epoch seconds.\n* **Retry-After**: The remaining time in seconds until the current rate limit window resets.\n\nThere are many ways to access header information for your requests, depending on how you are accessing the Linode API. For example, to view HTTP response headers when making requests with `curl`, use the `-i` or `--include` option as follows:\n\n```Shell\ncurl -i https://api.linode.com/v4/regions\n```\n\n## CLI (Command Line Interface)\n\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/linode/linode-cli\" target=\"_top\">Linode CLI</a> allows you to easily\nwork with the API using intuitive and simple syntax. It requires a\n[Personal Access Token](/docs/api/#personal-access-token)\nfor authentication, and gives you access to all of the features and functionality\nof the Linode API that are documented here with CLI examples.\n\nEndpoints that do not have CLI examples are currently unavailable through the CLI, but\ncan be accessed via other methods such as Shell commands and other third-party applications.\n",

Please send an email to api@loket.nl, and we will get back to you.\n\n\n## Environments\nThe Loket.nl API has two different environments.\nThe first environment is the \"acceptance\" environment which is used during development and returns test data.\nThe second environment is the production environment which is to be used exclusively by approved applications.\nBoth environments have their own URLs.\n* The acceptance environment can be accessed at https://api.loket-acc.nl/v2/ \n* The production environment can be accessed at https://api.loket.nl/v2/\n\n## OpenAPI documentation\nThe endpoints are defined using the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification),\nan industry-wide recognized standard for describing REST API's.\n\n__Please note:__ the endpoint documentation in this portal is not designed to be fully compatible with any automatic code generation tools.\n\n## Change policy\nOver the course of time the API, and policies regarding the API can and will change. These changes are subject to the following guidelines.\n\n\nThe following states hold true for the change policy for this API.\n\n* Loket.nl may sometimes introduce changes to the API and policies without advance notice. \n* Loket.nl will try to inform users of any (breaking) change in advance.\n* Loket.nl will not be liable to you or any third party for such modifications or any adverse effects resulting from such modifications.\n* Loket.nl will try to avoid breaking changes as much as possible.\n\n## Notification periods\nIn regard to changes Loket.nl will strive to adhere to the following notification periods per type of change.\nDue to our versioning strategy at resource level this API has the possibility to run multiple versions of the same resource at one time.\nThis allows for a window in which both the old and new version are available.\nAllowing for a gradual move to the new version. \n\n| Type of change | Notification period | Support period old version |\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Non breaking change | 2 weeks | no new version |\n| Breaking change | 2 weeks | 6 months |\n| Critical | Due to the nature of these changes we might not be able to follow the normal procedure for change managment | depends on the severity of the issue | \n\n\nWe define a __non breaking__ change as follows. Any change to the API that does not cause failures in the applications that consume that API.\n  * Introducing a new optional field to an existing resource\n  * Introducing a new endpoint\n  * Introducing a new operation (GET/PUT/POST/PATCH/DELETE)\n  * Introducing a new optional parameter to an endpoint\n  * Introducing a new version for a resource\n\nWe define a __breaking change__ as follows. any change to an API that could potentially cause failures in the applications that consume that API.\n  * Changing an existing JSON element (name, datatype, pattern, min/max length etc)\n  * Removing a JSON element, endpoint, operation or parameter\n  * Introducing a required JSON element\n  * Introducing a required parameter to an endpoint\n  * Passing the `obsoleteDate` of a version for a resource\n\n## Versioning\nThe Loket API uses two types of versioning. API versioning and resource versioning. \n\n\n__API versioning__\n\nAPI versioning is done via the path where after the domain URL (api.loket.nl) the path starts with the API version. The current version of the API is V2.\nThe API version is expected to change rarely as resource versioning is available to tackle most issues that need versioning.\n\n\n__Resource versioning__\n\nEvery __JSON__ resource in the API is versioned via the Accept header.\nAllowing users of the API to influence what version is returned by setting the __mandatory__ accept header.\nThe Accept header of request should have a value like `application/json;version=2018-01-01`. \nHere, the second part of the header is used to refer to a specific version of the resource (2018-01-01).\nWhen calling the API it is possible to supply other dates rather than the exact resources version(s). \nThe businesslogic will select the version that is ON or BEFORE the given date.\n\n\n__For example:__ let's say there are two versions of a resource.\nThese are 2018-01-01 and 2018-09-01. When calling the API you supply `application/json;version=2018-08-01`,\nin that case the API will use the version 2018-01-01 as its the nearest version in the past.  \n\n\nA response returns what `resourceVersion` was used and the 'obsoleteDate' of that version (in most cases this is NULL).\nThe `obsoleteDate` indicates when the resources version will no longer be available via the API.\nWith the introduction of a new version of a resource the `obsoleteDate` for the old version will be set to 6 months after the introduction of the new resource. \nAllowing consumers of the resource 6 months to incorporate the change. Failure to do so will likely lead to failure in the implementation.\n\nIn this developer portal you can find the service contracts for each, active, version of a resource.\nIf, only if, there are multiple versions of a resource you can select the corresponding schema at that resource.\n\n## Changelog\nThe changelog for this API can be found [here](/Changelog).\n\nWe strongly advise every user ofthe Loket REST API the subscribe to the email feed. Please check out the link on the changelog page.\n\n\n## Legal notices\nYour use and access to the API is expressly conditioned on your compliance with the policies and restrictions related to the API. \nIf Loket.nl believes that you have or attempted to violate any term, condition, or the spirit of these policies or agreements, your right to access and use the API may be temporarily or permanently revoked.  \n\n# Authentication\nAuthorization in the Loket API is based on the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol. For general information on OAuth 2.0 we kindly refer to the publicly-available documentation, https://oauth.net/2/ \n\n\nAn authorized user is required to call the Loket API.\n\n__Note:__ This is an SSL-only API.\n\n__Note:__ Only TLS 1.2 is supported.\n\n| Environment          | TokenUrl                             | \n| -------------------- | --------------------------------     | \n| Acceptance           | https://oauth.loket-acc.nl/token     |\n| Production           | https://oauth.loket.nl/token         | \n\nThe following OAuth 2.0 flows are supported\n\n* Authorization Code flow (standard)\n* Refresh Token flow (extension on the Authorization Code Flow)\n* SSO flow (single sign-on)\n* Password flow\n\n## Authorization code flow\nFor most clients only the authorization_code (and thus refresh_token) will be supported. \nPassword grant type is not available for an external client.\n\nPlease click the link below to see documentation on implementing the authorization code flow by external clients.\n\n__[Documentation on implementing the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](./OauthCode)__\n\n## Refresh token flow\nAfter the authorization code flow yields a refresh token the refresh_token grant can be used to obtain an access/bearer token.\nThe expire time of the access/bearer is also returned in the response please take this into account.\nWith the refresh token flow the two factor step will be skipped.\n\n_Refresh token request example:_\n```\nPOST /token \ngrant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={RefreshToken123}&client_Id={Client123}&client_secret={Secret123}\n```\n\n_Refresh token response example:_\n```json\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"JESJDhMBy0NPTM9SiXmYAzW45clOiQ5wSyDq3VWluguGNoKym4WPSiJoTDx67TQ\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"expires_in\": 3599,\n  \"refresh_token\": \"nGJtF6j6SeQbHAg\",\n  \"two_factor_state\": \"None\"\n}\n```\n## SSO flow\nThe SSO (single sign-on) flow is based on OAuth 2.0 and requires the authorization flow to be completed.\n\n__For more information see:__ [Documentation on OAuth 2.0 SSO flow (for allowed clients)](./OauthSSO)\n\n\n__Please note:__ Among other things, it is possible to set up an SSO flow with both Loket en Werknemerloket.\n\n\n## Password flow\nThe password flow is typically NOT enabled for external clients. Only by exception will the password flow be enabled for security (and practical) reasons.\n\n_Password token request examples:_\n\n```\nPOST /token \ngrant_type=password&username={UserName123}&password={Password123}&client_Id={Client123}&client_secret={Secret123}\n```\nWhether client_secret is required is dependent on the configuration of the client.\n\n# Authorization\nIn this section we explain how the API authorization service determines if a request is authorized or not.\n\n## The authorization entities\n\n| Entity | Description |\n| ----|----|\n| Client | Loket.nl used the client as an additional authorisation entity. By linking clients to activities clients can only perform those activities they are linked to. |\n| User  | Is linked to a client (by performing the authorization code flow) and to a set of rechten (configuration in loket.nl)|\n| Module (product) | Enables certain functionality for the provider/employer. Modules can be enabled and disabled on both provider and employer level.|\n| Role | Influences if certain \"rechten\" are available to the users with said role. It can also influence the scope of the data returned. For example: the API will deny an \"afdelings manager\" access to employee's that are not in the \"afdeling\" (department) that user is manager of|\n| Activity | Every action in the API has its own activity. Using the Open API 3.0 standard these activity names are incorporated in the documentation using the `operationId` and in most cases are named in the description of an endpoint.|\n| Rights (rechten) | Represent a group of activities.|\n\n## The authorization process\nThis flow assumes that both user and client are correctly configured and have access to the API. \n\n1. Does the client have access to the activity?\n2. Does the user have access to the activity (through \"recht\")?\n3. Does the role have access to the activity (through \"recht\")?\n4. Does the provider/employer have the required module enabled for the activity?\n5. Does the user have access to the specified entity/ID?\n\nIf the answer to all the questions above is yes then the request is authorized otherwise the request is denied with a HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden).\nSee the simplified authorization flow in the figure below.\n\n__Side note:__ users are linked to rechten and clients are linked to activities. This leaves room for discrepancies.\nWhere a client cannot perform the activity because the client is not authorized to call that activity even though the user does have the \"recht\" granting access to the activity.\n\n![Loket authorization flow](../Authorization_flow_extern.png)\n\n## Which users can use the API\nIn almost all use-cases a Loket user should meet the following requirements to successfully setup an integration with that user.\n\n* The user must be a normal Loket user (so NOT a webservice user)\n* The user must be active (not blocked)\n* The user must have access to an employer \n  * For provider users this is done by assigning the user to the appropriate Team(s)\n  * For employer users this is done by creating a user for or linking the user to the appropriate employer(s)\n* The user must have all appropriate rights\n  * For provider users this is done by assigning appropriate rights via Team (or alternatively, directly to the user)\n  * For employer users this is done by assigning appropriate rights to the user on employer level\n\n\nHow to setup an integration is described in the [Authentication](../#section/Authentication) section.\n\n\n__Side notes:__ \n* A user can have access to multiple employers with different rights per employer.\n* Please note that users set up to use the SOAP webservices (webservicegebruikers) are in no way suited to perform calls to the RESTful API, these require entirely different user set-ups.\n* User management on production is typically done by the provider (i.e. the accountant) and sometimes the employer. This is NOT something Loket.nl itself can do.\n\n# Data\n\n## Data types\nThe Loket.nl API accepts and returns JSON.\nComform the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) the following data types are supported:\n* string\n* number (point is used to separate the integer part from the fractional part of a number)\n* integer (from OpenAPI)\n* object\n* array\n* boolean\n\nFor most of these types, further specifications can be found in the `format` and `pattern` specifications in the service contract. \nFor example a `format: date` added to a string field indicates a valid date must be supplied.\n\n## Metadata\nFields of the type 'metadata' are fields for which the possible values can be acquired via the metadata endpoint of the resource.\n\nThe metedata can be obtained by appending /metadata to the current endpoint.\nUsing the GET verb the endpoint will return a JSON output with \"all\" the metadata for the given resource.\nIn some cases multiple requests are needed to obtain all the metadata required, an exmple is given below.\nTypically different metadata endpoints are availalbe for the POST and the PUT endpoint.\n\n\nIf metadata endpoints are avaible for a given endpoint/resource is mentioned in the description of that endpoint.\n\n### Example response\n```json\n{[\n  {\n      \"field\": \"gender\"\n      options: [\n          {\n          \"key\": 1,\n          \"value\":\"Man\"\n          }\n          {\n          \"key\": 2,\n          \"value\":\"Vrouw\"\n          }\n      ]\n   },\n   {\n      \"field\": \"country\"\n      options: [\n          {\n          \"isoCode\":\"NL\",\n          \"key\": 530,\n          \"value\":\"Nederland\"\n          }\n          {\n          \"isoCode\":\"BE\",\n          \"key\": 540,\n          \"value\":\"België\"\n          }\n      ]\n   }\n\n]}\n\n```\n\n\n### Example urls\n\n__Acquiring  metadata for a POST Wage__\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/employees/employments/{employmentId}/wages/metadata\n```\n\n\n__Acquiring metadata for a PUT employee__\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/employees/{employeeId}/metadata\n```\n\n__Multiple requests to get all the metadata__\n\nIn some cases there are metadata fields dependant on the selected value off another metadata field.\nSuch is the case when adding a new concept employee. This is done in the employer context while several of the metadata fields are dependant on the payrollAdministration context.\n\n\n__For example:__\n\n__Request 1__, first of a normal metadata request is performed. The response for this request will contain a list of payrolladministration for the given employer.\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/b869ded6-0659-4d8d-9a8a-f9e22425ec9c/jobapplicant/metadata\n```\n\n__Request 2__, when a payrolladministration is selected perform a second request to acquire the payrolladministration specific metadata.\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/jobapplicant/metadata/payrolladministration/54369214-14a1-41ab-892a-ea8438e34d6f\n```\n\n__Request 3__, if a `payScale` is selected perform a third request to acquire the `payGrade` for that `payScale`.\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/jobapplicant/metadata/salaryScaleType/54369214-14a1-41ab-892a-ea8438e34d6f\n```\n\n### Types of metadata\nWe diferentiate between two types of metadata.\n\n1. Generic metadata field. The possible values for these fields are the same for every object no matter the provider, employer or employee etc. \nExamples are: country, gender and nationality.\n2. Context specific metadata field. Examples of contexts are employer, payroll administration, provider and Loket.nl.\nIn most cases the possible values for these field are resources in themselves and can be managed via the API. \nIf a metadata field is context specific the context is given in the description of the field. \nExamples are: function, department and leaveType.\n\n\n__Note:__ some context specific metadata field can have multiple contexts. \n\nFor example: it is possible to define an export set in the provider context. \nMaking that export set available for all payroll administrations linked to the provider. \nIt is also possible to add an export set in the payroll administration context. That export set is only available to that payroll administration.\nWhen requesting the metadata of export set the user will be presented with a combined list of the provider and payroll administration export sets.\n\n## Default values\nMany fields in the API have a default value. \nIn order to assist our API users to adhere to these defaults when creating a record (POST) we provide `/defaults` endpoints.\n\n* An object returned by the `defaults`endpoint resembles a fully expanded GET-object of that resource. The only case when a part of the object is NOT fully expanded is for a metaData-object that does not have a default value (for example '\"gender\":NULL'). \n    * Whether an object within the resource is of the type metaData is indicated in the service contracts of that resource.\n* Context is determined by the GUID given in the Path. Examples are employer, payroll administration, employee and employment.\n* A scope is sometimes required to determine the defaults values. A scope could be a date by which Loket.nl can determine what default was active on that date. \n  The scope can be set by supplying additional paraments in the request. If a scope is required but none is given the currently active or last know value is returned.\n* The fields with no default will be set to null (even if the field is normally non-nullable).\n* Because the GET-object is returned the readonly fields are also returned.\n\n\n\n__An example endpoint would be:__\n\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/employees/employments/{employmentId}/payrollperioddata/defaults\n```\n\n__resulting in the following output:__\n\n```json\n{\n  \"payrollPeriod\": null,\n  \"shift\": {\n      \"shiftNumber\": 1\n  },\n  \"payslipType\": {\n      \"key\": 2\n  },\n  \"payslipText\": null,\n  \"distributionUnit\": {\n      \"key\": \"b14acd0d-75d7-4fc8-8b22-4a3924585cab\"\n  },\n  \"costCenter\": {\n      \"key\": 2\n  },\n  \"costUnit\": {\n      \"key\": 2\n  },\n  \"payrollComponents\": []\n}\n```\n\n__Note: Defaults endpoints are not yet generically available. If a Defaults endpoint exists this will be explicitly stated at that specific resource.__\n\n## Date chains\nFor most of the resources with a startDate and endDate a chain is maintained. Chain meaning that no records can overlap in time.\nLoket.nl has two types of chains.\n\n\n1) __Broken chain:__ It is posible for gaps te exist between the records. It is also posible to add new records in between or before existing records aslong as no overlap occures.\n\n2) __Linked chain:__ No gaps between records are allowed. Its only posible to add new records to the end of the chain resulting in the closing of the reviouse record with the start date -1 as end date.\n\n__Note:__ Chains are sometimes maintained with an additional context. For example, For `benefits and deductions` the broken chain is maintained per `payrollComponent`. \nIt is possible to have multiple active records for different `payrollComponent` never two active records for the same `payrollComponent`. \n\n## Custom export\nFor some GET (list) endpoints the API supports exporting (part of) the output JSON as a XML/CSV file. This is done by setting the `X-ReportInput` and `Accept` header.\n\nThe `Accept` header supports the following 2 options:\n* CSV (text/csv;version=yyyy-MM-dd)\n* Excel (application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet;version=yyyy-MM-dd)\n\n\nThe `X-ReportInput` is a custom header that requires a JSON object with the following structure as input.\n\nThe filename without extension for the report 'FileNameWithoutExtension'\ndelimiter --> The delimiter to be used. If not set \",\" is used\nArray of objects 'fields' with 2 fields:\n1. fieldName --> A Xpath reference to the field to be included in the export\n2. reportColumnName --> The column name for the field\n3. format --> Allows only for date formatting. e.g. dd-MM-yyyy for csv or dd-mm-yyyy for Excel (Excel only usses lowercase)\n  3.1 For CSV: see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings\n  3.2 For Excel: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/number-format-codes-5026bbd6-04bc-48cd-bf33-80f18b4eae68\n\n__Example `X-ReportInput`:__\n```json\n{\n\"fileNameWithoutExtension\":\"MyExport\",\n\"delimiter\": \";\",\n\"fields\":\n  [\n    {\n      \"fieldName\": \"startDate\",\n      \"reportColumnName\": \"In dienst datum\",\n      \"format\": \"dd-MM-yyyy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"fieldName\": \"personalDetails.firstName\",\n      \"reportColumnName\": \"First Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"fieldName\": \"personalDetails.lastName\",\n      \"reportColumnName\": \"Last Name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n__Example request:__\n```CURL\ncurl \n--location \n--request GET 'https://api.loket.nl/v2/providers/employers/155c8440-8ff6-4776-98db-5d2243a073e3/employees?orderby=employeeNumber' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Accept: text/csv;version=2020-08-18' \\\n--header 'X-ReportInput: {\"FileNameWithoutExtension\":\"MyExport\",\"Fields\":[{\"fieldName\":\"personalDetails.initials\",\"reportColumnName\":\"Initials\"},{\"fieldName\":\"personalDetails.firstName\",\"reportColumnName\":\"First name\"},{\"fieldName\":\"personalDetails.lastName\",\"reportColumnName\":\"Last name\"}]}' \\--header 'Authorization: Bearer ZKoiC_g_NfYA3v0' \\\n```\n\n\n# Request\nA request to the Loket.nl API consists of several components.\nEach of these components are discussed in this section.\n\n## Base URL\nThe API can be accessed at [https://api.loket.nl](https://api.loket.nl).\n The version of the API is specified in the URL. The current version of the Loket.nl API is version 2. To access version 2 of the API, one simply appends `v2` to the base URL. The full base URL of the API is therefore [https://api.loket.nl/v2](https://api.loket.nl/v2).\n\n## Endpoints\nThe endpoints defined in the OpenAPI definition of the Loket.nl API are appended to the base URL. For example, the endpoint `/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees` can be accessed at [https://api.loket.nl/v2/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees](https://api.loket.nl/v2/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees).\n\n## Path parameters\n\nMost endpoints require path parameter(s) in order to specify the context of the request. For example, the endpoint `/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees` contains the `employerId` path parameter. A path parameter is a unique identifier that identifies a specific resource, in this case an employer.\n\n## Pagination\n\nThe API supports two query parameters to control the pagination of the results: `pageNumber` and `pageSize`. Both of these query parameters only apply to endpoints that return lists of entities.\n\nThe `pageNumber` query parameter specifies which page of the collection to return. By default  `pageNumber` is set to 1 which returns the first page of the collection. Note: the pageNumber refers to the page (with a given number of entities), NOT to a specific entity within a page!\n\nThe `pageSize` query parameter influences the number of entities per page. By default `pageSize` is set to 250. Note that this default may change in the future. It is not recommended to depend on this default when developing for the Loket.nl API.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ```?pageNumber=2``` to return the second page\n* ```?pageSize=2``` to set the page size to two\n\n## Filtering\n\nThe API supports output filtering via the querystring parameter `filter`.\n\nFiltering is possible on all fields of the following datatypes:\n\n* string\n* integer\n* boolean\n* date-time\n* decimals\n\nThe following operators are available:\n\n| Operator             | Description           | Example                         |\n| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| Comparison Operators |                       |                                 |\n| eq                   | Equal                 | `city eq 'Redmond'`             |\n| ne                   | Not equal             | `city ne 'London'`              |\n| lk                   | Like                  | `city lk 'Lond'`                |\n| gt                   | Greater than          | `price gt 20`                   |\n| ge                   | Greater than or equal | `price ge 10`                   |\n| lt                   | Less than             | `price lt 20`                   |\n| le                   | Less than or equal    | `price le 100`                  |\n| Logical Operators    |                       |                                 |\n| and                  | Logical and           | `price le 200 and price gt 3.5` |\n| or                   | Logical or            | `price le 3.5 or price gt 200`  |\n\nBoth field names and values are case insensitive. It is possible to filter on nested fields by adding the parent object before the field with a '.' to separate them.\nDo remember to URL encode the filter parameters.\n\n### Examples\n\nAll employments with a cancellation periode in months (the value 4 corresponds to months time unit).\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=cancellationPeriodTimeUnit.key eq 4\n\n```\n\nAll employments with no endDate.s\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=enddate eq null\n\n```\n\n\nAll employments with an end date less or equal to 2017-01-01\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=enddate le '2017-01-01'\n\n```\n\nAll employees with a employee number greater or equal 1 and less or equal 5\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees?filter=employeeNumber ge 1 and employeeNumber le 5\n\n```\n\n## Ordering\n\nAll Loket.nl API resources support ordering of the elements in the response on a specific field. \nAll fields can be used in ordering. \nThe list can be ordered in ascending or descending order, with ascending being the default one. Ordering on multiple fields is also  by using a ',' as a separator.\n\n### Examples\n\nOrder employers by company name ascending\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=companyName\n\n```\n\nOrder employers by company name descending\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=-companyName\n\n```\n\nOrder employers by company name descending then by house number ascending\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=-companyName,address.houseNumber\n\n```\n\n## Headers\n\nIn order to access the endpoints of the Loket.nl API, at least two request headers need to be set. \n\n\n__1)__ the `Authorization` header is required in order to authorize the API call. \nThe value of this header is the word Bearer followed by a space and the access token acquired from the `/token` endpoint. \nFor example, if the acquired access token is `AbCdEf123456`, the value of the `Authorization` headers would be:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer v69uloc3wcEFLePw2unot0FfAJfBocrvSwsrCo75JLUG7aE54zqSUnU\n```\n\n__2)__ The second header that is required for proper usage of the API, is the `Accept` header.\nThis header is used for the resource versioning feature and is therefore crucial for making sure the response remains the same when new resource versions are introduced.\nThe value of the `Accept` header differs per endpoint is defined in the OpenAPI documentation of the endpoints.\n\n```\nAccept: application/json;version=2018-01-01\n```\n\n__3)__ In case of a PUT and sometimes a PATCH a third header is optional the if-match header. This header is used for concurrency control.\nEven though the header is optional we advise using this header on every PUT(PATCH) to ensure not losing data. \n\n```\nif-Match: aslkhas987da09s8udasd09a\n```\n\n# Response\n\nIn addition to the responses defined in the OpenAPI documentation, the Loket.nl API also provides additional fields that give more information about\nthe response and the entities requested. This section will explain the full response given by the Loket.nl API by examining the example response below.\n\n\nExample 400 response\n\n\n```json\n\n{\n    \"version\": {\n        \"obsoleteDate\": null,\n        \"versionNumber\": \"2018-01-01,\n    },\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"code\": 83,\n            \"id\": null,\n            \"type\": \"BrokenBusinessRule\",\n            \"description\": \"[field] has an invalid length\",\n            \"properties\": []\n        }\n    ],\n    \"_embedded\": []\n}\n\n```\n\n\nExample 200 response\n\n```json\n\n  {\n      \"totalSize\": 1,\n      \"pageSize\": 250,\n      \"totalPages\": 1,\n      \"currentPage\": 1,\n      \"version\": {\n          \"obsoleteDate\": null,\n          \"resourceVersion\": \"2018-01-01\"\n      },\n      \"messages\": [],\n      \"content\": {\n          \"id\": \"2b4c119c-527c-4cbb-a5b2-f3a11e4b76cx\",\n          ...\n      }\n  }\n\n```\n\n## Paging\n* `totalSize` has an integer value indicating the total number of entities irrespective of the page size.\n\n* `pageSize` has an integer value indicating the maximum number of entities returned per page. The page size can be influenced by setting the `pageSize` query parameter. See the section Query Parameters for more information.\n\n* `totalPages` has an integer value indicating the number of pages the requested collection holds given the specific pagesize.\n\n* `currentPage` has an integer value indicating the current page number. The current page number can be influenced by setting the `pageNumber` query parameter. See the section Query Parameters for more information.\n\n## Version\nThe `version` object provides information regarding the resource version of the entity requested.\n\n  * `obsoleteDate` contains the date of discontinuation for the requested resource version. The value of this field can be `null` indicating that the requested resource version is not planned to be obsoleted at the time of the request.\n\n  * `resourceVersion` shows the version of the requested entity. The resource version can be influenced by setting the `Accept` header.\n\n## Messages\nThe `messages` field contains a list of message objects related to the request made. Any warnings and errors will be communicated in this list of messages\n\n  * `type` has a string value indicating the type of message. At this time the Loket.nl API supports five types of messages: `BrokenBusinessRule`, `Warning`, `Exception`, `ConcurrencyViolation` and `NotFound` .\n  \n  * `description` has a string value that describes the message that has occurred.\n\n  * `code` is an identifying code for the message. Please note that this code may change in the future. See the documentation portal for possible message codes for an endpoint.\n\n  * `id` relates the message to a specific entity in the reponse list. For example, in cases where a warning occurs for one of the entities in a list, the value of this field can be used to identify to which entity the warning applies. Currently implemented for endpoints where a multi-patch is performed (multiple actions are performed within one call) for example updating the status of one or more leaveRequests. \n  \n  * `properties` an array that can contain additional information regarding the message. Currently not yet fully implemented.\n\n* `_embedded` contains the list of entities as defined for each endpoint in the OpenAPI documentation. Please refer to that documentation for the contents of the `_embedded` field for each endpoint. For endpoints that return only one entity (detail endpoints) the `_embedded` field is replaced with a `content` field. The content of this field can also be found in the documentation for each endpoint.\n\n## Headers\n* `etag` header is returned with every GET of a detail (single resource). This header is used for concurrency controle\n* `Expires` header is returned with every response to indicate how long a response can be cached\n* `Content-Disposition` header is used in case of downloads to provide a file name\n\n## HTTP status codes\n\nThe Loket.nl API supports the following http status codes.\n\n| Code | Is returned when |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| 200 | The request to GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE and object was recived and processed succesfully. The response might still contain messages of the type warning. |\n| 201 | The request to insert (POST) a new object was recived and processed succesfully. The response might still contain messages of the type warning.|\n| 400 | The request was received but could not be processed. The reason(s) will be given in the response. The content type of the response may be text/plain for API-level error messages, such as when trying to call the API without SSL otherwise the content will be application/json.  |\n| 401 | The bearer token provided in the authorization header is invalid. Do not retry the request until a new (valid) bearer token is acquired. |\n| 403 | The user is not authorized to access the resource. The reason will be given in the response. Do not retry the request until the, configuration, issue is resolved. |\n| 404 | The resource requested was not found/does not exist. |\n| 409 | The give if-match header in a PUT request no longer represents the current state of the object. Please acquire the current state off the object, via a GET, and resolve the differences then try again. |\n| 50* | A unforseen error occurred. Please check the request if everything seems te be in order on your side contact the support team. Provide as much information as possible to resolve the issue. |\n\nNote: for a limited number of endpoint a so-called multi-patch may be performed (multiple actions within one call). In that case the status code will be 200 if at least on of the actions succeeds, if other any action(s) in that call fail(s) a message will be returned including the given id of that entity.\n\n## Caching\nThe API uses the `Expires` header to indicate how long the item can be reused from the local cache.\nIn most cases caching is not allowed for resources.\nExceptions excist, such as pictures like the employer logo and the employee photo, in these cases the cache duration is mentioned in the description of the resource.\n",

    "description": "# Introduction\nThe Lumminary API was built to allow third parties to interact with Lumminary customers and gain access to their genetic data. The Lumminary API is fast, scalable and highly secure. All requests to the Lumminary API take place over SSL, which means all communication of Customer data is encrypted.\n\nBefore we dive in, some definitions. This is what we mean by:\n\n|Term|Definition|\n|-----------|-----------|\n|**Third party**|A third party (also referred to as \"partner\" or as \"you\") is a company which offers services and products using genetic data.|\n|**Lumminary clients**|The Lumminary client (also referred to as \"customer\") is an individual who has created an account on the Lumminary platform.|\n|**Lumminary**|This is  us - our services including the Lumminary platform, the API, the DNA App Store, the DNA Vault, the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button, and the website in its totality. |\n|**CWL**|This is the acronym for the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button.|\n|**dataset**|This is the term we use when we refer to a customer's genetic data.|\n|**Lumminary API**|This is a library/module that you can use to integrate your apps with the Lumminary platform.|\n|**Lumminary toolkit**|This is a stand alone application which helps you integrate with Lumminary without writing any code or interacting with the Lumminary API.|\n\nLet's dive in, now. \n* [**Overview**](#section/Introduction/Overview)\n\n* [**Install Lumminary API Client and Toolkit**](#Install-Lumminary-API-Client-andor-Toolkit)\n* [**Obtaining credentials**](#Obtaining-credentials)\n* [**Query customers authorizations**](#Query-customers-authorizations)\n* [**Query customer genetic data**](#Query-customer-genetic-data)\n* [**Submit reports**](#Submit-reports)\n\n* [**\"Connect with Lumminary\" button**](#the-connect-with-lumminary-button)\n\n* [**API specs**](#tag/Lumminary)\n\n## Overview\n\nIn order to use Lumminary services, you'll need to install the Lumminary API Client or Toolkit. The Lumminary API Client and Toolkit are available in multiple programming languages, and we also provide a sandbox environment which you can use for integration and tests.\n\nThere are a couple of differences between the API Client and the Toolkit. Mainly, it's about the ease of use for integration. The Toolkit is basically a stand-alone application that facilitates the integration with the Lumminary API without the need to modify your already existing code.\n\nYou use the Lumminary API Client when you want to integrate it inside your own application. This means it gives you full flexibility regarding the integration into your own workflow.\n\nYou use the Lumminary Toolkit for an integration where the Toolkit is placed alongside your own application. You can use the Toolkit from the CLI - for example, to run a cronjob that processes incoming orders. The Toolkit uses the Lumminary API Client.\n\n# Install Lumminary API Client and/or Toolkit\n\nWe provide the Lumminary API Client and Toolkit in multiple programming languages - default are PHP (minimum version 7.0), Python2.7 and Python3. However, if you need them in another language (Java, Obj-C, JavaScript, C#, Perl, CURL), please contact us.\n\n\n## How to install the Lumminary API Client\n\n#### PHP example:\nThe PHP Lumminary API Client is available at: https://github.com/Lumminary/lumminary-api-client-php\n\nIf you are already using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), you can import the project by adding the following to your `composer.json`\n```json\n\"repositories\": [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"git\",\n        \"url\": \"https://github.com/Lumminary/lumminary-api-client-php.git\",\n        \"reference\": \"master\"\n    }\n],\n\"require\": {\n    \"lumminary/api-client-php\": \"v1.0.6\"\n}\n```\n\nThen run `composer update lumminary/api-client-php`\n\n#### Python example:\n\nThe Python Lumminary API Client is available at: https://github.com/Lumminary/lumminary-api-client-python\n\nTo install directly, run\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://git@github.com/Lumminary/lumminary-api-client-python.git@v1.0.7#egg=lumminary-api-client\n```\n\nOr add the following line in your requirements.txt\n\n```bash\ngit+https://git@github.com/Lumminary/lumminary-api-client-python.git@v1.0.7#egg=lumminary-api-client\n```\n\n## How to install the Lumminary Toolkit\n\n#### PHP example:\nThe PHP Lumminary Toolkit is available at: https://github.com/Lumminary/lumminary-toolkit-php\n\nTo install the Lumminary Toolkit, run the following command where 'lumminary-toolkit-directory' is the directory where you want to install the Lumminary Toolkit:\n\n`git clone git@github.com:Lumminary/lumminary-toolkit-php.git lumminary-toolkit-directory`\n\n#### PYTHON example:\n\nThe Python Lumminary Toolkit is available at: https://github.com/Lumminary/lumminary-toolkit-python\n\nTo install the Lumminary Toolkit, run the following command where 'lumminary-toolkit-directory' is the directory where you want to install the Lumminary Toolkit:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:Lumminary/lumminary-toolkit-python.git lumminary-toolkit-directory\ncd lumminary-toolkit-directory\nvirtualenv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nNote that before running the toolkit, you should have the virtualenv enabled, like so : `source lumminary-toolkit-directory/env/bin/activate`\n\n## Toolkit Setup\n\nWe recommend to run the Toolkit in a cronjob; at every run it will check for new Authorizations (Orders) and will download them; afterwards it will check for a new reports folder inside the old authorizations, process the reports, and delete the processed Authorizations and Reports from your server. \n\nThe first step after you clone the Lumminary Toolkit project for your language is to configure it with your credentials. \n\nGo to the Lumminary Toolkit base diretory `cd lumminary-toolkit-directory`. Under the Toolkit directory, you will find a file `config/config_template.json` which has the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"api_key\": <your-api-key>,\n    \"product_uuid\": <your-product-uuid>,\n    \"api_host\": \"https:\\/\\/api.lumminary.com\\/v1\",\n    \"output_root\": <your-authorization-data-basepath>,\n    \"export_handler\": <your-export-handler-class>,\n    \"product_name\": <your-product-name>,\n    \"operations\": [\n        \"pull_datasets\",\n        \"push_reports\"\n    ],\n    \"optional\": {\n        \"dna_data_filename\": \"dna-data.tsv\",\n        \"authorization_metadata_filename\": \"authorization-metadata.json\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou should copy this config `cp config/config_template.json config/my-product1-config.json` then edit it `vim config/my-product1-config.json` to contain the following values:\n\n| Config attribute | Example Value                      | Description |\n|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|\n| api_key        | `\"TiiU...bqg==\"`                   |Your Lumminary API key.<br> You can obtain it from the Lumminary Admin  |\n| product_uuid   | `\"1234-1234-1234-1234\"`            |Your product UUID. This value can be obtained from the Lumminary Admin |\n| api_host       | `\"https:\\/\\/api.lumminary.com\\/v1\"`   |   The API endpoint to use.<br>For the sandbox environment you can use \"https:\\/\\/sandbox-api.lumminary.com\\/v1\"    |\n| output_root    | `\"/var/lumminary-orders/product1/\"`         | The base directory where the Toolkit places the Authorizations for your Product <br> The Lumminary Toolkit will *never* overwrite Authorization data or create this directory, to protect from overwrites or typos    |\n| export_handler |`\"export_handler_tsv\"`  | If you have a custom export handler, then your Lumminary contact will provide you with the name of your export handler.   |\n| operations       |`[\"pull_datasets\", \"push_reports\"]`        | These are two optional parameters that define the tasks that the Toolkit should perform. Possible values are: <br> 1. `pull_datasets` - this tells the Toolkit to download the Customer Authorization (Customer details and genetic data) <br> 2. `push_reports` - this tells the Toolkit to push the results to the API; see below for more details|\n| optional       | `{}`                               | Export handler specific value |\n\nAfter updating the config file for your Toolkit, it should look similar to (Note that these are all dummy values) :\n\n```json\n{\n    \"api_key\": \"TiiU...bqg==\",\n    \"product_uuid\": \"1234-1234-1234-1234\",\n    \"api_host\": \"https:\\/\\/api.lumminary.com\\/v1\",\n    \"output_root\": \"\\/var\\/lumminary-orders\\/product1\\/\",\n    \"export_handler\": \"export_handler_tsv\",\n    \"product_name\": \"product 1\",\n    \"operations\": [\n        \"pull_datasets\",\n        \"push_reports\"\n    ],\n    \"optional\": {\n        \"dna_data_filename\": \"dna-data.tsv\",\n        \"authorization_metadata_filename\": \"authorization-metadata.json\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can now save and exit the text editor `:wq` and start polling the API for new Authorizations :\n\nPython\n\n```bash\n# While still in the <lumminary-toolkit> directory\nsource env/bin/activate;\npython lumminary_partner_toolkit.py --config-path config/my-lumminary-product1-config.json\n```\n\nPHP\n\n```bash\n# While still in the <lumminary-toolkit> directory\nphp lumminary-partner-toolkit.php --config-path config/my-lumminary-product1-config.json\n```\n\nWhen your Product receives new Authorizations, the Toolkit will pull all the relevant data and save it in the following files:\n\n```bash\n# The DNA data file. Format compatible with 23AndMe by default\n<output_root>/<authorization_uuid>/dna-data.tsv\n\n# The Authorization metadata\n<output_root>/<authorization_uuid>/authorization.json\n```\n\nThe contents of the files pulled when processing an Authorization are as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ head -n 5 <output_root>/<authorization_uuid>/dna-data.tsv\n# rsid      chromosome  position        genotype\nrs12070387  1           6267531         CC\nrs149124387 1           12025561        CC\nrs116458387 1           14920119        AA\nrs4436387   1           15498452        CC\n\n$ cat <output_root>/<authorization_uuid>/authorization.json \n{\n    \"authorization\": <authorization_uuid>,\n    \"created_timestamp_utc\": 1542920184,\n    \"customer\": <customer_uuid>,\n    \"customer_address\": {\n        \"address1\": <address1>,\n        \"address2\": <address2>,\n        \"city\": <city>,\n        \"country\": <country>,\n        \"state\": <state>,\n        \"zipcode\": <zipcode> \n    },\n    \"customer_email\": <customer_email>,\n    \"customer_name\": {\n        \"first_name\": <customer_first_name>,\n        \"last_name\": <customer_last_name>\n    },\n    \"dataset\": <dataset_uuid>,\n    \"product\": <your_product_uuid>\n}\n```\n\nAfter the Toolkit downloaded the Authorizations, you need to process the Customer genetic data file and the Customer details, individually. The Lumminary API supports multiple types of products:\n\n| Scenario | How to Report |                    \n|------------------|------------------------------------|\n|The product is a file (.pdf, .jpeg etc.) | Put the result file(s) into the `tmp_reports` directory. Please refer to the Note underneath this table. |\n|The product requires authentication | Create a file with the name `result.json` into the `tmp_reports` directory, with the following content: <br> `{ \"credentials\": { \"username\": \"username@example.com\", \"password\": \"your generated password\", \"url\": \"https://your-website.com/report\"}}`<br> The `url` should point to a login page that upon authentication redirects the user to the report page. You can find the customer's email address in the `authorization-metadata.json` and the `password` attribute must be a secure password. Please refer to the Note underneath this table. |\n|The product is a physical product| Create a file with the name `result.json` into the `tmp_reports` directory, with the following content: <br> `{\"physical_product\": { \"physical_product_completed\": true }}` <br> This should be done upon dispatch. Please refer to the Note underneath this table. |\n|An error occurred| Create a file with the name `result.json` into the `tmp_reports` directory, with the following content: <br> `{ \"unfulfillable\": {\"error\": \"Reasons for why it is unfulfillable\", }}` <br> The error message is for Lumminary internal usage, and it won't be visible to the customer. This will delete your Authorization, making it unuseable thereafter. So please use this only for unfixable errors, and never for temporary errors you attempt to resolve. Please refer to the Note underneath this table. |\n\n###### Note\nFor each scenario above, we recommend you use a temporary directory to avoid uploading incomplete files or reports. So your workflow should be:\n* create a temporary directory inside the `<output_root>/<authorization_uuid>`, such as `<output_root>/<authorization_uuid>/tmp_reports/`  \n* place your result file(s) in the `tmp_reports` directory (as in the above table)\n* rename the directory from `tmp_reports` to `reports`\n\nWe recommend running the Toolkit in a cronjob, wrapped by some locking mechanism. Also, Toolkit logs are very minimal but can be very helpful when debugging an issue, so please consider saving them to a file. For example, the following cronjob runs the Toolkit every minute:\n\n```bash\n# Open the crontab\ncrontab -e\n```\n\nPHP Toolkit\n\n```bash\n# Add the following line (replace <lumminary-toolkit-directory> with the absolute path of the Lumminary Toolkit)\n* * * * * flock /var/lock/lumminary-toolkit.lock php <lumminary-toolkit-directory>/lumminary-partner-toolkit.php --config-path <lumminary-toolkit-directory>/config/my-product1-config.json >> /var/log/lumminary-toolkit.log\n```\n\nPython Toolkit\n\n```bash\n# Add the following line (replace <lumminary-toolkit-directory> with the absolute path of the Lumminary Toolkit)\n* * * * * flock /var/lock/lumminary-toolkit.lock source env/bin/activate; python <lumminary-toolkit-directory>/lumminary_partner_toolkit.py --config-path <lumminary-toolkit-directory>/config/my-product1-config.json\n```\n\n## API endpoints\nLumminary provides two endpoint APIs, sandbox and production. You can use the sandbox for your integration and testing, simulate orders, upload genetic data, and generate reports. The sandbox works exactly like the production environment, and you can test your end-to-end integration.\n\nIn order to simulate a complete order, you need to use this test credit card: \n\n|Credit card number  | Expiration date| CVV2|\n|--------------------|----------------|-----|\n|4242 4242 4242 4242 |  12/30         | 123 |\n\n### Sandbox\nwebsite: [sandbox-www.lumminary.com](https://sandbox-www.lumminary.com)\n\napi-hostname: [sandbox-api.lumminary.com/v1](https://sandbox-api.lumminary.com/v1)\n\n### Production\nwebsite: [lumminary.com](https://lummianary.com)\n\napi-hostname: [api.lumminary.com/v1](https://api.lumminary.com/v1)\n\n# Obtaining credentials\nTo obtain credentials, you need to register as a Lumminary partner. You can do this by [filling in this form](https://lumminary.com/register-for-connect-with-lumminary).\n\nYou will then receive the following:\n\n|Credentials|Description|\n|-------|-------|\n|Product UUID|Each product you register on the Lumminary platform gets an UUID which will be used to identify that product to the Lumminary API|\n|API key|The secret API key associated with the Product UUID|\n|Partner UUID|Upon your first registration on the Lumminary platform, you will receive a single Partner UUID, which identifies you as one entity, regardless of product. This identifier is used for the Connect with Lumminary (CWL) functionality.|\n|CWL Encryption Key|The CWL encryption key is associated with the Partner UUID and is used to encrypt all communication for the Connect with Lumminary functionality.|\n\nEach product or service needs to have its own product UUID and API key, which means you have to fill in the form for all products and services that require access to Lumminary customer data.  \n\n## Configure the credentials to the Lumminary API Client\nThe easiest way to set up your credentials is to use an environment file.\n\nFor this, you must create a file named `env.json` (but any name will do) in your project directory, which should contain:\n```json\n{\n    \"product_uuid\": <your_product_uuid>,\n    \"api_key\": <your_product_api_key>,\n    \"role\": \"role_product\",\n    \"api_host\": <lumminary_api_hostname_endpoint>\n}\n```\n\nIn order to load the Credentials from the `env.json`, you can use the following code:\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\nrequire_once(__DIR__.\"/vendor/autoload.php\");\n$credentials = new Lumminary\\Client\\Credentials();\n$credentials->loadJSONCredentials(__DIR__.\"/env.json\");\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\nimport lumminary_sdk as lumminary\nimport os\n\ncredentials = lumminary.Credentials()\ncredentials.load_json_credentials(\n    os.path.join(\n        os.getcwd(),\n        \"env.json\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n## Alternative credentials configuration\nYou also have the option of passing the credentials as constructor parameters when instantiating the `Credentials` class.\n\n#### PHP example:\n\n```php\nrequire_once(__DIR__.\"/vendor/autoload.php\");\n$credentials = new Lumminary\\Client\\Credentials(\n    <lumminary_api_hostname_endpoint>,\n    <your_product_uuid>,\n    <your_product_api_key>\n);\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n\n```python\nimport lumminary_sdk as lumminary\n\ncredentials = lumminary.Credentials(\n    product_uuid = <your_product_uuid>,\n    api_key = <your_product_api_key>,\n    api_host = <lumminary_api_hostname_endpoint>,\n    role = \"role_product\"\n)\n```\n\n## Create an API instance\n\nWith the credentials configured and loaded, you can create an API client like so : \n\n#### PHP example\n\n```php\n$apiClient = new Lumminary\\Client\\ApiClient($credentials);\n```\n\n#### Python example\n\n```python\napiClient = lumminary.LumminaryApi(credentials)\n```\n\n# Query customers authorizations\nAn Authorization represents permission from a client to access their personal and genetic data. \n\nThere are 2 situations where customers grant you access to their data: \n* when a customer buys your product from the Lumminary DNA App Store\n* when a customer clicks on the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button on your website\n\nEach time either of the above situations happens, our platform creates an Authorization UUID. You can reliably assume that if you have an Authorization UUID, you automatically have access to all the personal information and genetic data needed by your products and services. After you process an Authorization you need to mark it as processed; processed Authorizations will no longer be on the list of new authorizations.\n\nThere are two ways to obtain the Authorization UUID:\n* _polling_ - this method allows you to periodically interrogate our API and pulls the list of Authorization UUIDs. \n* _webhooks_ (coming soon) - this method allows our API to push the Authorization UUIDs into your platform.\n\n## Poll method\n\nTo use the polling method, your servers periodically interrogate for new Authorization UUIDs. Please keep in mind that Authorizations not marked as processed will always be returned when polling for new Authorizations. This means there's a risk of parallel processing the same Authorization. To avoid this, you can, for example, consider using locking when processing.\n\n#### A PHP example of using the polling API looks like:\n\n```php\n$productAuthorizations = $apiClient->getAuthorizationsQueue(\n    $apiClient->getCredentials()->getProductUuid(),\n);\n\nforeach($productAuthorizations as $productAuthorization)\n{\n    /**\n     *  Add your code for processing customer data here\n     **/ \n    \n    // Mark Authorization as processed \n    $apiClient->postProductAuthorization(\n        $productAuthorization[\"productUuid\"],\n        $productAuthorization[\"authorizationUuid\"]\n    );\n}\n```\n\n#### A Python example of using the polling API looks like:\n\n```python\nproductAuthorizations = apiClient.get_authorizations_queue(\n    apiClient.get_credentials().product_uuid\n)\n\nfor productAuthorization in productAuthorizations:\n    #######\n    #   Add your code for processing customer data here\n    #######\n\n    # Mark Authorization as processed\n    apiClient.post_product_authorization(\n        productAuthorization.product_uuid,\n        productAuthorization.authorization_uuid\n    )\n```\n\nBased on the Authorization object obtained previously, we can now query the customer's information (personal details and genetic data).\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$authorizationMetadata = $apiClient->authorizationMetadata($productAuthorization[\"authorizationUuid\"]);\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\nauthorizationMetadata = apiClient.authorization_metadata(productAuthorization.authorization_uuid)\n```\n\n#### authorizationMetadata object object structure\n\n| Attribute name            | Description                                                                                |\n|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `customer`                | The UUID of the customer granting the Authorization                                        |\n| `product`                 | The UUID of the product that was authorized (your product UUID)                            |\n| `authorization`           | The UUID of the granted Authorization.                                                     |\n| `created_timestamp_utc`   | The unix timestamp in UTC time zone when the customer granted the Authorization            |\n| `dataset`                 | (present only if requested) The UUID of the dataset authorized by the customer             |\n| `customer_email`          | (present only if requested) Customer contact email                                         |\n| `customer_name`           | (present only if requested) Customer name                                                  |\n| `customer_address`        | (present only if requested) Customer address                                               |\n\nBy *present only if requested* we mean this attribute will be returned if at the time of configuring either the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button or your product, you have explicitly requested for that particular set of data.\n\n# Query customer genetic data\nBased on the Authorization object obtained previously, now we have authorizationMetadata which contains the customer's information (personal details and genetic data). Let's use this information to extract some customer genetic data.\n\n## Get individual SNPs\nOut of all the available SNPs in the dataset, you can only access those for which the customer has previously granted permission.\n\nFor example, fetching details for a particular SNP:\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$rsId = \"rs114326054\";\n$snpDetails = null;\n\n// check to see if you have access to the customer genetic data\nif (isset($productAuthorization[\"scopes\"][\"dataset\"]))\n{\n    // get SNP information\n    $snpDetails = $apiClient->getClientSnp(\n        $productAuthorization[\"clientUuid\"],\n        $productAuthorization[\"scopes\"][\"dataset\"],\n        $rsId\n    );\n}\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\nrsId = \"rs114326054\"\nsnpDetails = None\n\n# check to see if you have access to the customer genetic data\nif hasattr(productAuthorization.scopes, \"dataset\"):\n    # get SNP information\n    snpDetails = apiClient.get_client_snp(\n        productAuthorization.client_uuid,\n        productAuthorization.scopes.dataset,\n        rsId\n    )\n```\n\n##### The snpDetails object will contain these important attributes:\n\n| Attribute name PHP     | Attribute name Python        | Description                                               |\n|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `snpId`                 | `snp_id`                    | The rsid of the SNP                                       |\n| `referenceGenome`        |`reference_genome`          | The reference genome known to be used by the Dataset's source. <br> This impacts the reference allele, location, and based on the dbSNP build, also the SNP's accession |\n| `genotypedAlleles`       | `genotyped_alleles`        | The genotype value of the customer's queried SNP. <br><br> If the attribute of this SNP has the `phased` flag set to True, <br>the first items in the lists for all SNPs will be on the same inherited chromosome, <br>and analogous for the second item. <br><br> If the SNP is unphased, the order of the items is irrelevant |\n|`phased`                   | `phased`                  | A boolean.

These are all the SNPs configured as mandatory for your product, as well as all SNPs that are configured as optional and available in the customer's data set. We encourage you to use this option if you need to get all available SNPs, because it is faster than fetching SNP details one by one.\n\nFor example, fetching all authorized SNPs:\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$datasetSnps = null;\n\n// check to see if you have access to the customer genetic data\nif (isset($productAuthorization[\"scopes\"][\"dataset\"]))\n{\n    // get all authorized SNPs\n    $datasetSnps = $apiClient->getClientSnpGroup(\n        $productAuthorization[\"clientUuid\"], \n        $productAuthorization[\"scopes\"][\"dataset\"]\n    );\n}\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\ndatasetSnps = None\n\n# check to see if you have access to the customer genetic data\nif hasattr(productAuthorization.scopes, \"dataset\"):\n    # get all authorized SNPs\n    datasetSnps = apiClient.get_client_snp_group(\n        productAuthorization.client_uuid,\n        productAuthorization.scopes.dataset\n    )\n```\n\n##### The datasetSnps variable will be a list of objects each having the following attributes:\n\n| Attribute name PHP     | Attribute name Python        | Description                                               |\n|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `snpId`                  | `snp_id`                   | The rsid of the SNP                                       |\n| `referenceGenome`        |`reference_genome`          | The reference genome known to be used by the Dataset's source. <br> This impacts the reference allele, location, and based on the dbSNP build, also the SNP's accession |\n| `genotypedAlleles`       | `genotyped_alleles`        | The genotype value of the customer's queried SNP. <br><br> If the attribute of this SNP has the `phased` flag set to True, <br>the first items in the lists for all SNPs will be on the same inherited chromosome, <br>and analogous for the second item. <br><br> If the SNP is unphased, the order of the items is irrelevant |\n|`phased`                   | `phased`                  | A boolean. True if the SNP is known to be phased, False otherwise |\n|`chromosomeAccession`     | `chromosome_accession`     | This is the chromosome accession number where the SNP is located; in the format of NC_00x |\n|`location`                 | `location`                | This is the customer's SNP's location on the chromosome |\n\nWhen trying to access any customer's SNP for which you don't have permission, an `Unauthorized` exception will be raised.\n\n## Get Genes\n\nAlong with individual SNPs, you can also get all the authorized SNPs from a particular gene, that are available in the customer's dataset.\n\nHere, by genes, we refer strictly to the genomic region that produces some protein, without considering regulatory or noncoding regions that influence gene expression.\n\nThe gene name (known as symbol) can be from either of these two databases - NCBI and Ensembl.\n\nFor example, fetching details for a gene symbol:\n\n#### PHP example\n```php\n$geneSymbol = \"C1ORF159\";\n$geneDetails = null;\n// check to see if you have access to the customer genetic data\nif (isset($productAuthorization[\"scopes\"][\"dataset\"]))\n{\n    // get all authorized SNPs within a gene\n    $geneDetails = $apiClient->getClientGene(\n        $productAuthorization[\"clientUuid\"],\n        $productAuthorization[\"scopes\"][\"dataset\"],\n        $geneSymbol\n    );\n}\n```\n\n#### Python example\n```python\ngeneSymbol = \"C1ORF159\"\ngeneDetails = None\n# check to see if you have access to the customer genetic data\nif hasattr(productAuthorization.scopes, \"dataset\"):\n    # get all authorized SNPs within a gene\n    geneDetails = apiClient.get_client_gene(\n        productAuthorization.client_uuid,\n        productAuthorization.scopes.dataset,\n        geneSymbol\n    )\n```\n\n##### All the geneDetails object attributes are\n\n| Attribute name PHP | Attribute name Python    | Description                                                                              |\n|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `molecularLocation`  | `molecular_location`   | An object containing the location of the gene within the chromosome - see below the molecular location object structure  |\n| `snps`                | `snps`                | A list of SNP objects present in the gene - see below the SNP object structure           |\n| `symbol`              | `symbol`              | The gene's accession string (name)                                                       |\n\n##### Molecular location attributes \n\n| Attribute name PHP     | Attribute name Python    | Description                                                                              |\n|:-------------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `chromosomeAccession`    | `chromosome_accession` | The scaffold/chromosome on which the gene is placed                                      |\n| `start`                   | `start`               | The gene's start position on the scaffold                                                |\n| `stop`                    | `stop`                | The gene's stop position on the scaffold                                                 |\n\n##### SNP object structure\n\n| Attribute name PHP     | Attribute name Python    | Description                                                                              |\n|:-------------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `referenceGenome`        | `reference_genome`     | The reference genome known to be used by the Dataset's source. <br> This impacts the reference allele, location, and based on the dbSNP build, also the SNP's accession|\n| `genotypedAlleles`       | `genotyped_alleles`    | The genotype value of the customer's queried SNP. <br><br> If the attribute of this SNP has the `phased` flag set to True, <br>the first items in the lists for all SNPs will be on the same inherited chromosome, <br>and analogous for the second item. <br><br> If the SNP is unphased, the order of the items is irrelevant                                          |\n| `phased`                  | `phased`              | A boolean.

To do this, you will notify us using the function below. Finally, the customer will then:\n\n* access their report file through a written electronic document (eg. .pdf or .doc)\n* access their report on your website under an account with a username and a password or\n* receive a physical product\n\n## How to submit a report file\n\nWhen you submit such a report file, Lumminary will save this document into the customer's account, from which the customer will then be able to access it directly.\n\n#### PHP example\n```php\n$pathToReportFile = <path_to_report_file>;\n$fileReport = new \\SplFileObject($pathToReportFile); \n$friendlyFileName = \"report_file_name\"; //optional, give a friendly name to your report file\n$apiClient->postAuthorizationResultFile(\n   $productAuthorization[\"productUuid\"],\n   $productAuthorization[\"authorizationUuid\"],\n   $fileReport,\n   $friendlyFileName\n);\n```\n\n#### Python example\n```python\npathToReport = <path_to_report_file>\noriginalFilename = \"report_file_name\" #optional, give a friendly name to your report file\napiClient.post_authorization_result_file(\n   productAuthorization.product_uuid,\n   productAuthorization.authorization_uuid,\n   pathToReport,\n   originalFilename\n)\n```\n\nIf you need to upload multiple files, you have to call the function for each file, one at a time. \n\n## How to submit a report so the customer can access it on your website\n\nIf the customer's results can be accessed on your website, you will need to create a customer account on your platform, generating a user and password which will be sent through the Lumminary API into the customer's Lumminary account. \n\nIn case you don't generate a user and a password for the customer to access their report, use the function below with \"null\" value to username and password. We recommend you use the URL for customer reports on a dedicated page for reports only, rather than your homepage or some other generic page.\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$apiClient->postAuthorizationResultCredentials(\n   $productAuthorization[\"productUuid\"],\n   $productAuthorization[\"authorizationUuid\"],\n   <username_generated_by_you>, //optional, default null\n   <password_generated_by_you>, //optional, default null\n   <report_on_your_website_url> // https://partnerwebsite.com/reports.php?reportid=a7508\n);\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\napiClient.post_authorization_result_credentials(\n   productAuthorization.product_uuid,\n   productAuthorization.authorization_uuid,\n   <username_generated_by_you>, # optional, default null\n   <password_generated_by_you>, # optional, default null\n   <report_on_your_website_url> # https://partnerwebsite.com/reports.php?reportid=a7508\n)\n```\n\n## How to submit a physical product\nIn case you only send the customer a physical product and you don't generate any reports, you need to run the function below so we can mark the order as fulfilled and can inform the client.\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$apiClient->postProductAuthorization(\n  $productAuthorization[\"productUuid\"],\n  $productAuthorization[\"authorizationUuid\"]\n);\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\napiClient.post_product_authorization(\n   productAuthorization.product_uuid,\n   productAuthorization.authorization_uuid\n)\n```\n\n# The Connect with Lumminary button\n\nThe \"Connect with Lumminary\" functionality allows you to get customer details and genetic data from the Lumminary platform for free, anytime you want, for as long the customer grants you access. This functionality offers your customers the option to share their genetic data and other personal information (e.g. name, address, email etc.) stored on the Lumminary platform. \n\nHaving this button on your website makes it very easy for the customer to share their genetic data with you, as they don't have to download and re-upload their data on your site. The customer always has the option to revoke your access to both their personal details and their genetic data.\n\n**`To protect the customer's privacy, you are not allowed to save their data anywhere. You can, however, always access their data on the Lumminary platform, for as long as they grant you access. If you generate a report based on customer data, you are allowed to save that report on your platform.`**\n\nIn order to implement this functionality on your website, this is what you need to know:\n* Register your product on the Lumminary platform\n* Add the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button to your website\n* Configure your website to retrieve customer data\n* Possible errors\n\n## Register your product on the Lumminary platform\n\nIf you're new to the Lumminary platform and don't already have any products in the DNA App Store, then you need to register by [filling in this form](https://lumminary.com/register-for-connect-with-lumminary).\n\nYou have to fill in the form for all products and services that require access to Lumminary customers' genetic data.  \n\n## Add the Connect with Lumminary button to your website\n\nSince the CWL flow involves encrypting and decrypting data, we recommend installing the Lumminary API Client, where you'll find some specific helper functions. \n\nIn order to enable the button, you have to include the following script in the `<head>` tag of all the pages where you want to enable the “Connect with Lumminary” button:\n\n```html\n<head>\n    <script defer src=\"https://lumminary.com/cwl/cwl.js\"></script>\n</head>\n```\n\nThe Javascript creates a CSRF token and attaches it to the button to be transmitted and verified on our servers each time a user clicks on the button. The CSRF token expires after 5 minutes. In case the CSRF token is expired or tampered, the user will be redirected to your website where it's up to you to decide what to do next - reload the page with the button or show the customer an error message.\n\nThe `cwl.js` file is loaded as a deferred resource, which means that it will load after all the webpage code execution has been finished, so it will not have any impact on your website load speed.\n\n### Chose a button colour\n\nThere are two type of buttons, so you can pick one that matches your branding. The buttons are SVG images, which means that you can scale them up or down to fit your design, without compromising on image quality. You can do this by changing the image height.\n\n##### a.

See details below. \n\n#### Data-request object\n\nThe data-request object has a standard format which needs to be preserved. It is formed of two types of data, some mandatory and some optional. You can use the optional fields to add any metadata or other information for your own use. The data-request object is going to be returned with the response from the authentication without being altered.\n\n##### Mandatory information\n\nThe mandatory information is a list of scopes which you ask the client to grant permission for. These scopes are comma delimited, and the possible options are: `address`, `email`, `dataset`.\n\nThe scopes _address_, _email_, and _dataset_ can be used in any combination; you must request at least one scope.\n\n| Attribute name    | Description                                         |\n|:-----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------|\n| `address`         | Requests access to a customer's name and address.   |\n| `email`           | Requests access to a customer's email address.      |\n| `dataset`         | Requests access to a customer's genetic data        |\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$objAuthorizationRequest [\"scopes\"] = \"address,dataset,email\";\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\nobjAuthorizationRequest [\"scopes\"] = \"address,dataset,email\"\n```\n\nProduct UUID is your `productUuid` for which you ask customer permissions.\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"productUuid\"] = $credentials->getProductUuid();\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"productUuid\"] = credentials.product_uuid\n```\n\n##### Optional information\n\nIn the optional part of the object, you can add any useful data, such as customer ID,  session ID, or any parameter which can help you identify the response from Lumminary.\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"] = array();\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"customerId\"] = <partner-customer-id>;\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"websiteSession\"] = <customer-session>;\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"customData3\"] = <Some addional data>;\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"] = {}\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"customerId\"] = <partner-customer-id>\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"websiteSession\"] = <customer-session>\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"customData3\"] = <Some addional data>\n```\n\nSee below a complete example for a data-request object:\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"scopes\"] = \"address,dataset,email\";\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"productUuid\"] = <product-UUID>;\n\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"] = array();\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"customerId\"] = <partner-customer-id>;\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"websiteSession\"] = <customer-session>;\n$objAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"customData3\"] = <Some addional data>;\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\nobjAuthorizationRequest = {}\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"scopes\"] = \"address,dataset,email\"\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"productUuid\"] = <product-UUID>\n\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"] = {}\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"customerId\"] = <partner-customer-id>\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"websiteSession\"] = <customer-session>\nobjAuthorizationRequest[\"customData\"][\"customData3\"] = <Some addional data>\n```\n\n## Creating the Authorization Request\n\nThe previously generated object (`objAuthorizationRequest`) will now need to be encrypted. In order to be able to encrypt the object and also query the Lumminary API to obtain the customer details and genetic data, you need to have the Lumminary API Client installed. If you haven't done this already, please follow these [steps](#Install-Lumminary-API-Client-andor-Toolkit).\n\n### Add data-request attribute\n\nAfter you have the Lumminary API Client installed correctly you can use the command below:\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n// You have recieved the CWL encryption key after filling in the form for product registration\n$partnerCwlKey = <partner-encryption-key>;\n$requestValueEncryptedUrlEncoded = Lumminary\\Client\\LumminaryApi::cwl_data_request_build(\n    $objAuthorizationRequest,\n    $partnerCwlKey\n);\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\nimport lumminary_sdk as lumminary\n\n# You have recieved the CWL encryption key after filling in the form for product\npartnerCwlKey = <partner-encryption-key> \nrequestValueEncryptedUrlEncoded = lumminary.LumminaryApi.cwl_data_request_build(objAuthorizationRequest, partnerCwlKey)\n```\n\nThe resulting string should be added in the `data-request` attribute of the `<a>` tag of the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button.\n\n### Add data-partner-uuid attribute\n\nAdd the `data-partner-uuid` in the `data-partner-uuid` attribute of the `<a>` tag of the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button. You have received the partner UUID after filling in the form for product registration.\n\nAn example of a button correctly configured should look like this:\n\n```html\n<a class=\"lumminary-connect-btn\" data-partner-uuid=\"4231-7446-2543-6542\" data-request=\"7LfMX811Als0l%2FAvf84pB7n3mcycnTjgWl1FaVNffdqiOApMn4HAnk0Ux6eatObfYmxf1xPRjo7nBojsL4ImgOL932NK2Ei4VoUXjs9Y%2BcvphI0kxBSblLaeVXNPbJO9LsuNP%2BHJzDBAnZZdAObgYxHH2QDY3VD%2Ff%2FBXKw9WYDdBssAoegMFEJ9GgYutFQ4nTPXAt%2FdWCqoxYbZrYpCj2Pphk9lstc4Ib%2BLNxKiEtNCmVGr6sgmR2lPBwgylTsEX%2FMRCJb6sdQyZBhvSQCMFb0p3%2B9tEwV0%3D\" style=\"cursor:pointer; text-decoration:none;\" href=\"https://lumminary.com\">\n   <img src=\"https://lumminary.com/cwl/connect-with-lumminary-white.svg\" alt=\"Lumminary DNA tests\" height=\"50\" title=\"Connect with Lumminary\">\n</a>\n```\n\n## Connect with Lumminary summary of user interaction\n\nWhen a customer clicks on the “Connect with Lumminary” button, a pop-up window opens. After they choose which genetic file to share, the pop-up will automatically close and the user will be redirected to your callback URL in the parent window. Your callback URL needs to be predefined in the Lumminary partner portal. \n\nThe GET request from the client to your callback URL will contain two querystring parameters - `request` and `response`:\n\n1. `request` – this is exactly the same request that you previously sent in the `data-request` field. You can decrypt it with the CWL encryption key which you used to encrypt it.\n2. `response` – the response is an urlencoded encrypted serialized JSON object which contains the Authorization UUID and the Authorization UTC unix timestamp. You will use the Authorization UUID to get the customer's data with the Lumminary API Client. The response string is encrypted with your CWL encryption key, the same as the `data-request` parameter. \n\nIn order to decrypt the `response` parameter, you can use the following function:\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n// the entire callback URL, including the querystring parameters\n$callbackUrlWithPayload = \"https://partnerwebsite.con/callback?request=...&response=...\";\n\n$cwlReturnObject = Lumminary\\Client\\LumminaryApi::cwl_url_query_extract(\n    $callbackUrlWithPayload, \n    $partnerCwlKey  \n);\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\n// the entire callback URL, including the querystring parameters\ncallback_url_with_payload = \"https://partnerwebsite.con/callback?request=...&response=...\"\n\ncwlReturnObject = apiClient.cwl_url_query_extract(\n    callback_url_with_payload,\n    partner_cwl_key\n)\n```\n\nThe `cwlReturnObject` will now contain an object like the example below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"request\": <your-request-parameter-echoed>,\n    \"response\": {\n        \"authorizationUuid\": <cwl-authorization-uuid>,\n        \"authorizationTimestamp\": <cwl-authorization-created-timestamp>\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith the Authorization UUID (`authorizationUuid`) you can [query all the customer details](#Query-customer-genetic-data) from the Lumminary platform.\n\n## Possible errors\n\nWhen an error occurs, the customer is redirected to your callback URL. The redirect contains two querystring parameters - `request` and `response` - exactly like a regular response, but the `response` parameter contains an error object (see below) instead of an Authorization object.\n\n#### PHP example:\n```php\n// the entire callback url, including the querystring parameters\n$callbackUrlWithPayload = \"https://partnerwebsite.con/callback?request=...&response=...\";\n\n$cwlReturnObject = Lumminary\\Client\\LumminaryApi::cwl_url_query_extract(\n    $callbackUrlWithPayload, \n    $partnerCwlKey  \n);\n```\n\n#### Python example:\n```python\n# the entire callback url, including the querystring parameters\ncallback_url_with_payload = \"https://partnerwebsite.con/callback?request=...&response=...\"\n\ncwlReturnObject = apiClient.cwl_url_query_extract(\n    callback_url_with_payload,\n    partner_cwl_key\n)\n```\n\nExample of a return object (`cwlReturnObject`) containing an error message:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"request\": <your-request-parameter-echoed>,\n    \"response\": {\n        \"error\": {\n            \"id\": <error id>,\n            \"message\": <error message>\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n| Error Id          | Error Message                                                                                |\n|:-----------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1                 | Invalid Security Token                                                                       |\n| 2                 | Invalid Access Scopes                                                                        |\n| 3                 | Customer refuses your request (this happens when the customer cancels instead of granting access) |",

    "description": "Musixmatch lyrics API is a robust service that permits you to search and retrieve lyrics in the simplest possible way. It just works.\n\nInclude millions of licensed lyrics on your website or in your application legally.\n\nThe fastest, most powerful and legal way to display lyrics on your website or in your application.\n\n#### Read musixmatch API Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy:\nBefore getting started, you must take a look at the [API Terms & Conditions](http://musixmatch.com/apiterms/) and the [Privacy Policy](https://developer.musixmatch.com/privacy). We’ve worked hard to make this service completely legal so that we are all protected from any foreseeable liability. Take the time to read this stuff.\n\n#### Register for an API key:\nAll you need to do is [register](https://developer.musixmatch.com/signup) in order to get your API key, a mandatory parameter for most of our API calls. It’s your personal identifier and should be kept secret:\n\n```\n  https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/v1.1/track.get?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n#### Integrate the musixmatch service with your web site or application\nIn the most common scenario you only need to implement two API calls: \nThe first call is to match your catalog to ours using the [track.search](#!/Track/get_track_search) function and the second is to get the lyrics using the [track.lyrics.get](#!/Lyrics/get_track_lyrics_get) api. That’s it!\n\n## API Methods\nWhat does the musiXmatch API do?\n\nThe musiXmatch API allows you to read objects from our huge 100% licensed lyrics database.\n\nTo make your life easier we are providing you with one or more examples to show you how it could work in the wild. You’ll find both the API request and API response in all the available output formats for each API call. Follow the links below for the details.\n\nThe current API version is 1.1, the root URL is located at https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/\n\nSupported input parameters can be found on the page [Input Parameters](https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/input-parameters). Use UTF-8 to encode arguments when calling API methods.\n\nEvery response includes a status_code. A list of all status codes can be consulted at [Status Codes](https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/status-codes).\n\n## Music meta data\nThe musiXmatch api is built around lyrics, but there are many other data we provide through the api that can be used to improve every existent music service.\n\n## Track\nInside the track object you can get the following extra information:\n\n### TRACK RATING\n\nThe track rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is a song in musixmatch.\n\nYou can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular songs of an artist, of a music genre, of a lyrics language.\n\n### INSTRUMENTAL AND EXPLICIT FLAGS\n\nThe instrumental flag identifies songs with music only, no lyrics.\n\nThe explicit flag identifies songs with explicit lyrics or explicit title. We're able to identify explicit words and set the flag for the most common languages.\n\n### FAVOURITES\n\nHow many users have this song in their list of favourites.\n\nCan be used to sort tracks by num favourite to identify more popular tracks within a set.\n\n### MUSIC GENRE\n\nThe music genere of the song.\n\nCan be used to group songs by genre, as input for similarity alghorithms, artist genre identification, navigate songs by genere, etc.\n\n### SONG TITLES TRANSLATIONS\n\nThe track title, as translated in different lanauages, can be used to display the right writing for a given user, example:\n\nLIES (Bigbang) becomes 在光化門 in chinese\nHALLELUJAH (Bigbang) becomes ハレルヤ in japanese\n\n\n## Artist\nInside the artist object you can get the following nice extra information:\n\n### COMMENTS AND COUNTRY\n\nAn artist comment is a short snippet of text which can be mainly used for disambiguation.\n\nThe artist country is the born country of the artist/group\n\nThere are two perfect search result if you search by artist with the keyword \"U2\". Indeed there are two distinct music groups with this same name, one is the most known irish group of Bono Vox, the other is a less popular (world wide speaking) group from Japan.\n\nHere's how you can made use of the artist comment in your search result page:\n\nU2 (Irish rock band)\nU2 (あきやまうに)\nYou can also show the artist country for even better disambiguation:\n\nU2 (Irish rock band) from Ireland\nU2 (あきやまうに) from Japan\nARTIST TRANSLATIONS\n\nWhen you create a world wide music related service you have to take into consideration to display the artist name in the user's local language. These translation are also used as aliases to improve the search results.\n\nLet's use PSY for this example.\n\nWestern people know him as PSY but korean want to see the original name 싸이.\n\nUsing the name translations provided by our api you can show to every user the writing they expect to see.\n\nFurthermore, when you search for \"psy gangnam style\" or \"싸이 gangnam style\" with our search/match api you will still be able to find the song.\n\n### ARTIST RATING\n\nThe artist rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an artist in musixmatch.\n\nYou can use this information to build charts, for suggestions, to sort search results. In the example above about U2, we use the artist rating to show the irish band before the japanese one in our serp.\n\n### ARTIST MUSIC GENRE\n\nWe provide one or more main artist genre, this information can be used to calculate similar artist, suggestions, or the filter a search by artist genre.\n\n\n\n## Album\nInside the album object you can get the following nice extra information:\n\n### ALBUM RATING\n\nThe album rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an album in musixmatch.\n\nYou can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular albums of an artist.\n\n### ALBUM RATING\n\nThe album rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an album in musixmatch.\n\nYou can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular albums of an artist.\n\n### ALBUM COPYRIGHT AND LABEL\n\nFor most of our albums we can provide extra information like for example:\n\nLabel: Universal-Island Records Ltd.\nCopyright: (P) 2013 Rubyworks, under license to Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment.\nALBUM TYPE AND RELEASE DATE\n\nThe album official release date can be used to sort an artist's albums view starting by the most recent one.\n\nAlbum can also be filtered or grouped by type: Single, Album, Compilation, Remix, Live. This can help to build an artist page with a more organized structure.\n\n### ALBUM MUSIC GENRE\n\nFor most of the albums we provide two groups of music genres. Primary and secondary. This information can be used to help user navigate albums by genre.\n\nAn example could be:\n\nPrimary genere: POP\nSecondary genre: K-POP or Mandopop\n",

    "description": "## Functionality at a glance\r\n\r\nThe NBG \"UK OPB - Account and Transaction v3.1.5\" API follows the [UK Open Banking Specification\r\n    v3.1.5](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.5/profiles/account-and-transaction-api-profile.html)\r\n\r\nThis Account and Transaction API Specification describes the flows and payloads for retrieving a list of accounts and their transactions.\r\n\r\nThe API endpoints described here allow a AISP to:  \r\n\r\n* Create the Consent with the appropriate permissions in order to be able to access the API Endpoints\r\n\r\n* Retrieve the list of accounts\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's details\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's balances\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's transactions\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's beneficiaries\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's standing orders\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's party\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's scheduled payments\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's statements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick Getting Started\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB\r\n\r\n2. Go to **\"APPS\"**\r\n\r\n3. Select your Organization and go to step 4. If you want to create a new Organization click **\\\"CREATE AN ORGANIZATION\\\"** and follow the steps below:\r\n\t1. Enter the title of your Organization\r\n\t2. Enter a short description of your Organization (optional)\r\n\t3. Click **\"SUBMIT\"**\r\n\r\n4. Select the Organization of choice and click **\"ADD AN APPLICATION\"** \r\n\t  1. Fill in the forms (title and short description)\r\n\t  2. Check **\\\"Authorization Code\\\" and \\\"Client Credentials\\\"** \r\n\t  3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)\r\n\t\t  \r\n\t\t  You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*\r\n\t  4. Click **\"SUBMIT\"**\r\n\t  5. Store the APPs **\"Client ID\"** and **\"Client Secret\"**\r\n5. Go to **\"API PRODUCTS\"** and select the **ACCOUNT INFORMATION - UK OPEN BANKING API**\r\n\r\n6. Click **\\\"START USING THIS API\\\"**, choose your app and click\r\n**\"SUBSCRIBE\"**\r\n\r\n7. Get an Access Token using the Access Token Flow and the API scopes provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below\r\n\r\n8. Create a Sandbox\r\n\r\n9. Play with the API \r\n\r\n\r\n### Sandbox Flow\r\n\r\nThe Sandbox Flow matches the Production Flow. The difference lies into the Data used. Instead of live\r\ndata, the Sandbox flow uses mocked data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Production Flow  \r\n\r\nThe Production Flow is described in the [UK Open Banking v3.1.5\r\nSpecification](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.5/profiles/account-and-transaction-api-profile.html)\r\n\r\nMore details about the implementation specifics followed, please visit section **UK OPB Implementation\r\nSpecifics**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)\r\n\r\nThis API version uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization, which means that a\r\nBearer (access token) should be acquired. An access token can be retrieved using the client_id and\r\nclient_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this API, and your own credentials\r\n(username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology HUB. The scopes are defined below:\r\n\r\n**Authorization Endpoint:** \r\n\r\n\t  https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize\r\n\r\n\r\n**Token Endpoint:** \r\n\r\n\t  https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token\r\n\r\n### Authorization Code ###\r\n\r\n**Sandbox Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t  sandbox-uk-account-info-api-v1 offline_access\r\n\r\n\r\n**Production Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t  accounts offline_access\r\n\r\n### Client Credentials ###\r\n\r\n**Sandbox Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t  sandbox-uk-account-info-api-v1\r\n\r\n\r\n**Production Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t  accounts\r\n\r\n\r\nSee more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)\r\n\r\n## QWAC Certificates\r\n\r\nTPPs are required to present a QWAC certificate during API consumption. The API checks that this certificate has been provided and is valid. In sandbox mode the certificate validations are optional. To validate your certificate in sandbox implementation, please send us your QWAC certificate at developer@nbg.gr and set the HTTP Header **\\\"x-sandbox-qwac-certificate-check\\\"** with the value **\\\"true\\\"** in your requests. \r\n\r\n## SMS Challenge (One Time Password)\r\n\r\nIn order to successfully authorize an Accounts Access you will need to provide the SMS OTP (One Time Password) in the corresponding Accounts Consent UI Screen.\r\n\r\nBy default the SMS OTP will be sent to the mobile number declared upon singing up in the NBG Technology HUB. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Create your Sandbox\r\n\r\nCreate a new Sandbox application by invoking the POST /sandbox. This call will generate a new Sandbox\r\nwith a unique sandbox-id.\r\n\r\n\r\n__Important!__ Before proceeding save the sandbox id you just created.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you create a sandbox, users and sandbox specific data are generated as sample data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Start Testing\r\n\r\nOnce you have your sandbox-id, you can start invoking the rest of the operations by providing the\r\nmandatory http header **sandbox-id**  and the http headers described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important notes\r\n\r\n\r\n**Request headers**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following HTTP header parameters are required for every call:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Authorization. The Auth2 Token\r\n\r\n2. sandbox-id. Your Sandbox ID\r\n\r\n\r\n**Consent**\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to effectively start using the Endpoints the appropriate Consent needs to be\r\ncreated and set to the 'Authorised' status. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to create the Consent you need to at least set the required **permissions** and the **Risk**\r\nsections. \r\n\r\n\r\nOptionally you may set the \r\n\r\n\r\n1. ExpirationDateTime. When the Consent expires \r\n\r\n\r\n2. TransactionFromDateTime. Start Date to retrieve the transactions \r\n\r\n\r\n3. TransactionToDateTime. End Date to retrieve the transactions \r\n\r\n**Not Implemented Endpoints**\r\n\r\nThe following endpoints are not implemented in the API\r\n\r\n1. GET /balances\r\n2. GET /transactions\r\n3. GET /beneficiaries\r\n4. GET /accounts/\\{AccountId\\}/direct-debits\r\n5. GET /direct-debits\r\n6. GET /standing-orders\r\n7. GET /accounts/\\{AccountId\\}/product\r\n8. GET /products\r\n9. GET /accounts/\\{AccountId\\}/offers\r\n10. GET /offers\r\n11. GET /scheduled-payments\r\n12. GET /statements\r\n\r\n\r\n## Error Codes\r\n\r\nThe error codes and their description can be found\r\n[here](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.5/profiles/read-write-data-api-profile.html#error-response-structure)\r\n\r\n\r\n# UK OPB Implementation Specifics \r\n\r\nBelow you may find more specific information &amp; limitations regarding the implementation followed in the Production API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Token Endpoint Client Authentication\r\n\r\nAt this point the supported __Client Authentication__ method is \"__Client Secret Basic__\" - usage of \"Client ID\" &amp; \"Client Secret\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## Consent Authorization\r\n\r\nFor a PSU to Authorize a Consent, they need to be redirected to the appropriate Consent UI.\r\n\r\nFor this redirection to take place the TPP needs to follow the Authorization Endpoint by amending the generated \"Consent ID\", like this: https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize?consent_id={{consent_id}}&amp;client_id={{client_id}}&amp;scope={{scope}}&amp;redirect_uri={{redirect_uri}}&amp;response_type=code\r\n\r\nOnce the PSU is redirected to the Consent Authorization Screen, they need to enter their IBank (Production) or Developer Portal (Sandbox) Credentials and either Authorize or Reject the Consent.\r\n\r\nAt this point the Consent is binded with the PSU.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Debtor Account\r\nCurrently, only the \"UK.OBIE.IBAN\" scheme is supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Feedback and Questions\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback and answer your questions.

The APIs are organized by the flows - **identification**, **consent flow**, **data flow** and **monitoring**. They represent the APIs that are expected to be available at the HIU end by the Gateway. \n  2. For majority of the APIs, if Gateway has initiated a call, there are corresponding callback APIs on the Gateway. e.g for **/consents/hiu/notify** API on HIU end, its expected that a corresponding callback API **/consents/hiu/on-notify** on Gateway is called. Such APIs are organized under the **Gateway** label. \n  3. Gateway relevant APIs for HIUs are grouped under **Gateway** label. These include the APIs that HIPs are required to call on the Gateway. For example, to request a CM for consent, HIU would call **/consent-requests/init** API on gateway. \n  4. **NOTE**, in some of the API documentations below, **X-HIP-ID** is mentioned in header (for example in /auth/on-init). These are the cases, when a particular API is applicable for both HIU and HIP (e.g an entity is playing the role of HRP representing both HIU and HIP).

Additionally, you can see all of this information in your [Account](https://account.nowpayments.io/invoices) on NOWPayments website.\n    \n\n# API Documentation\n\n## Instant Payments Notifications\n\nIPN (Instant payment notifications, or callbacks) are used to notify you when transaction status is changed.  \nTo use them, you should complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Generate and save the IPN Secret key in Store Settings tab at the Dashboard.\n2.  Insert your URL address where you want to get callbacks in create_payment request. The parameter name is ipn_callback_url. You will receive payment updates (statuses) to this URL address.\n3.  You will receive all the parameters at the URL address you specified in (2) by POST request.  \n    The POST request will contain the *x-nowpayments-sig* parameter in the header.  \n    The body of the request is similiar to a [get payment status](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7907941/S1a32n38?version=latest#0b77a8e3-2344-4760-a0bd-247da067db6d) response body.  \n    Example:  \n    {\"payment_id\":5077125051,\"payment_status\":\"waiting\",\"pay_address\":\"0xd1cDE08A07cD25adEbEd35c3867a59228C09B606\",\"price_amount\":170,\"price_currency\":\"usd\",\"pay_amount\":155.38559757,\"actually_paid\":0,\"pay_currency\":\"mana\",\"order_id\":\"2\",\"order_description\":\"Apple Macbook Pro 2019 x 1\",\"purchase_id\":\"6084744717\",\"created_at\":\"2021-04-12T14:22:54.942Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-04-12T14:23:06.244Z\",\"outcome_amount\":1131.7812095,\"outcome_currency\":\"trx\"}\n4.  Sort all the parameters from the POST request in alphabetical order.\n5.  Convert them to string using  \n    [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) (params, Object.keys(params).sort()) or the same function.\n6.  Sign a string with an IPN-secret key with HMAC and sha-512 key\n7.  Compare the signed string from the previous step with the x-nowpayments-sig , which is stored in the header of the callback request.  \n    If these strings are similar it is a success.  \n    Otherwise, contact us on [support@nowpayments.io](mailto:support@nowpayments.io) to solve the problem.\n    \n\nExample of creating a signed string at Node.JS\n\n```\nconst hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', notificationsKey);\nhmac.update(JSON.stringify(params, Object.keys(params).sort()));\nconst signature = hmac.digest('hex');\n\n```\n\nExample of comparing signed strings in PHP\n\n```\nfunction check_ipn_request_is_valid()\n    {\n        $error_msg = \"Unknown error\";\n        $auth_ok = false;\n        $request_data = null;\n        if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG']) && !empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'])) {\n            $recived_hmac = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'];\n            $request_json = file_get_contents('php://input');\n            $request_data = json_decode($request_json, true);\n            ksort($request_data);\n            $sorted_request_json = json_encode($request_data, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES);\n            if ($request_json !== false && !empty($request_json)) {\n                $hmac = hash_hmac(\"sha512\", $sorted_request_json, trim($this->ipn_secret));\n                if ($hmac == $recived_hmac) {\n                    $auth_ok = true;\n                } else {\n                    $error_msg = 'HMAC signature does not match';\n                }\n            } else {\n                $error_msg = 'Error reading POST data';\n            }\n        } else {\n            $error_msg = 'No HMAC signature sent.';\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\n## Recurrent payment notifications\n\nIf an error is detected, the payment is flagged and will receive additional recurrent notifications (number of recurrent notifications can be changed in your Store Settings-> Instant Payment Notifications).\n\nIf an error is received again during processing of the payment, recurrent notifications will be initiated again.\n\nExample: \"Timeout\" is set to 1 minute and \"Number of recurrent notifications\" is set to 3.\n\nOnce an error is detected, you will receive 3 notifications at 1 minute intervals.\n\n## Several payments for one order\n\nIf you want to create several payments for one Order you should do the following:\n\n*   Create a payment for the full order amount.\n*   Save \"purchase_id\" which will be in \"create_payment\" response\n*   Create next payment or payments with this \"purchase_id\" in \"create_payment\" request.\n*   **Only works for partially_paid payments**\n    \n\nIt may be useful if you want to give your customers opportunity to pay a full order with several payments, for example, one part in BTC and one part in ETH. Also, if your customer accidentally paid you only part of a full amount, you can automatically ask them to make another payment.\n\n## Packages\n\nPlease find our out-of-the box packages for easy integration below:\n\n[JavaScript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nowpaymentsio/nowpayments-api-js)\n\n\\[PHP package\\]  \n([https://packagist.org/packages/nowpayments/nowpayments-api-php](https://packagist.org/packages/nowpayments/nowpayments-api-php))\n\nMore coming soon!\n\n## Payments",

    "description": "The Socrata OpenDataNetwork (ODN) REST API exposes public data, often continuosly updated and enhanced, from many thousands of public\ngovernment and non profit agencies.\n\nMuch of this data originating from independent sources is fused together to create new, and often\npowerful, entity level data. The API, in addition to search and autosuggest capabilities for finding datasets,\nenables data based comparisons across geographical regions such as states, counties, metropolitan areas,\ncities and zip codes using highly vetted data providers such as US Census, BEA, HUD and others. Comparison data\nis preformatted for easy and efficient display on a chart, graph or interactive map.\n\nThe API also exposes data organized by narrative style questions a human might ask. The questions can\nbe rapidly found using an autosuggest style index, and then used to directly access all data needed to\nthoroughly and authoritatively answer the question. Retrieved data includes time series (temporally aligned),\ntabular, map heavy (includes spatial boundaries), and auto generated unstructured descriptive text.\n\nThe ODN API does not duplicate API endpoints or services provided by public sector agencies, but rather,\nreturns context relevant pre-populated REST URLs, when appropriate, so the caller can access data\ndirectly from the source.\n\nThe [open source](http://github.com/socrata/odn-backend) API powers [OpenDataNetwork.com](http://OpenDataNetwork.com), an [open source](http://github.com/socrata/opendatanetwork.com)\nsite; the site highlights myriad uses and provides API badges with contextually relevant API example\nREST endpoints and documentation pointers.\n\nFinally, we continuously add new dat sources which appear automatically in the API, so if your favorite data\nsource is not available, check back soon. You can also join us [HERE](http://www.opendatanetwork.com/join-open-data-network)\nand receive updates or let us know which data sources you are most interested in.\n\n## App Tokens\n\nRegistering for and including a [Socrata application token](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html)\nis _required_ for the ODN API. They can be passed either using the `app_token` parameter\nor the `X-App-Token` HTTP header.",

    "description": "# Introduction\n[OpenFinTech.io](https://openfintech.io) is an open database that comprises of standardized primary data for FinTech industry.<br>\nIt contains such information as geolocation data (countries, cities, regions), organizations, currencies (national, digital, virtual, crypto), banks, digital exchangers, payment providers (PSP), payment methods, etc.<br>\nIt is created for communication of cross-integrated micro-services on \"one language\". This is achieved through standardization of entity identifiers that are used to exchange information among different services.<br>\n\n### UML\nUML Domain Model diagram you can find [here](https://api.openfintech.io/public_domain_model.png).<br>\n\n### Persistence\nEntities are updated not more than 1 time per day.<br>\n\n### Terms and Conditions\nThis *OpenFinTech.io* is made available under the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/).<br>\nAny rights in individual contents of the database are licensed under the [Database Contents License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/).<br>\n\n### Contacts\nFor any questions, please email - info@openfintech.io<br>\nOr you can contact us at <a href=\"https://gitter.im/paymaxicom/openfintech.io\">Gitter</a><br>\n\nPowered by [Paymaxi](https://www.paymaxi.com)\n\n# Get Started\n\nIf you use [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com) or similar program which can operate with swagger`s files - just [download](https://docs.openfintech.io) our spec and [import it](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/importing_swagger). Also you can try live [API demo](https://api.openfintech.io).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe OpenFinTech API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.<br>\nAPI is based on [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) standard. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.<br>\nJSON API requires use of the JSON API media type (`application/vnd.api+json`) for exchanging data.<br>\n### Additional Request Headers\n#### ACCEPT HEADER\nYour requests should always include the header:\n```curl\nAccept: application/vnd.api+json\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nTo use OpenFinTech API no needed authorization.\n\n## Versioning\n\nWhen we make changes to the API, we release new, dated versions. The current version is **2017-08-24**. Read our [API upgrades guide]() to see our API changelog and to learn more about backwards compatibility.\n\n## Pagination\n\nOpenFinTech APIs to retrieve lists of banks, currencies and other resources - paginated to **100** items by default. The pagination information will be included in the list API response under the node name `meta` - contains information about listed objects [`total` - contains information about total count of listed objects, `pages` - count of pages], `links` - contain links to navigate between pages [`first` - link to first page, `prev` - link to previous page, `next` - link to next page, `last` - link to last page].<br>\nBy default first page will be listed. For navigating through pages, use the page parameter (e.g. `page[number]`, `page[size]`).<br>\nThe `page[size]` parameter can be used to set the number of records that you want to receive in the response.<br>\nThe `page[number]` parameter can be used to set needed page number.<br>\nExample of response:\n```json\n{\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"total\": 419,\n    \"pages\": 42\n  },\n  \"links\": {\n    \"first\": \"/v1/{path}?page[number]=1&page[size]=10\",\n    \"prev\": \"/v1/{path}?page[number]=39&page[size]=10\",\n    \"next\": \"/v1/{path}?page[number]=41&page[size]=10\",\n    \"last\": \"/v1/{path}?page[number]=42&page[size]=10\"\n  }\n```\n\n### Sorting\n\nOpenFinTech\\`s API supported query parameter to sort result collection [e.g. `?sort=code`]. Information about available parameters may be found in the endpoint description. Positive parameter [e.g. `?sort=code`] points to ascending sorting, negative  [e.g. `?sort=-code`] - to descending sorting. Also, supported multiple sorting parameters [e.g. `?sort=code, -name, id`, etc.]\n```curl\nhttps://api.openfintech.io/v1/countries?sort=name,-area\n```\n\n### Filtering\n\nFiltering provided by unique query key `filter[*filtering_condition*]`. Information about available parameters may be found in the endpoint description.\n```curl\nhttps://api.openfintech.io/v1/countries?filter[region]=europe\n```\n\n## Images\n\nOpenFinTech provides two types of images: icons and logos. To get one of those types you should to use next url pattern:\n``` curl\nhttps://api.openfintech.io/v1/{path}/{id}/{icon/logo}\n```\nAlso, images can be resized by adding next parameters: `h={height}&w={width}`. For example, you want to get organization icon with width equals to 20 pixels:\n``` curl\nhttps://api.openfintech.io/v1/organizations/{id}/icon?w=20&h=20\n```\nIf argument height or width is missing API returns original image with real sizes.\n\n## Errors\n\nAPI uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with OpenFinTech's servers (these are rare).\n\n| Code | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 200 - OK\t| Everything worked as expected. |\n| 400 - Bad Request |\tThe request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |\n| 401 - Unauthorized |\tNo valid API key provided. |\n| 402 - Request Failed\t| The parameters were valid but the request failed. |\n| 404 - Not Found |\tThe requested resource doesn't exist. |\n| 409 - Conflict\t| The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |\n| 429 - Too Many Requests |\tToo many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |\n| 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors |\tSomething went wrong on OpenFinTech's end. (These are rare.) |\n",

    "description": "### The Open Targets Platform REST API\n\nThe Open Targets Platform API ('Application Programming Interface') allows programmatic retrieval of the Open Targets Platform data via a set of [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) services.\n\nYou can make calls to the latest version of our API using the base URL `https://platform-api.opentargets.io/v3/platform`. Please make sure you use `https` instead of the unencrypted `http` calls, which we do not accept.\n\nWe list below the methods available to query our data directly from the API, followed by an interactive interface that you can use to try out the parameters and execute the REST-API calls.\n\nFor every request you create, the interactive interface will display both a [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) command and a request URL that you can use to ensure you get the expected response before using your application or workflow. \n\nCheck our documentation for some [API tutorials](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/tutorials/api-tutorials) and [get in touch](mailto:support@targetvalidation.org) if you have any questions.\n\n### Available Methods\n\nThe available methods can be grouped in three types:\n\n* __public__ - Methods that serve the core set of our data. These are stable and we fully supported them.\n* __private__ - Methods used by the web app to serve additional data not specific to our platform. These methods\nmay change without notice and should be used with caution.\n* __utils__ - Methods to get statistics and technical data about our API.\n\n### Supported formats\n\nThe methods above are all available via a `GET` request, and will serve outputs as `JSON`.\n\nAlternative output formats, such `xml`, `csv` and `tab`, are also available for some of the methods. However alternative output formats are not supported in interactive interface below where the response will be always in `JSON.\n\nIf you have complex queries with large number of parameters, you should use a `POST` request instead of  `GET`. \n`POST` methods require a body encoded as `json`. When querying for a specific disease using the latest version of the API, your call would look like the example below:\n\n```sh\ncurl -X POST -d '{\"disease\":[\"EFO_0000253\"]}' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' https://platform-api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/public/evidence/filter\n```\n### How to interpret a response\n\nEach HTTPS response will serve data in headers and body. The headers will give you details about your query, such as how long it took to run.\n\nIn the body of the response, you will find the data you have requested for in `JSON` format. The [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) program is a useful tool to parse the json response while on the command line.\n\n```sh\ncurl https://platform-api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/public/association/filter\\?target\\=ENSG00000157764 | jq\n```\n\nWe do not analyse the nature of any specific API queries except for the purposes of improving the performance of our API.\nRead more in our [privacy section](https://www.targetvalidation.org/terms_of_use#privacy).\n\nHow can we make the Open Targets Platform API more useful to you? Would you like additional methods to be implemented?\nPlease [get in touch](mailto:support@targetvalidation.org) and send your suggestions.\n",

    "description": "\n# Introduction\n\nWhether you're looking to build an official Pandascore integration for your service, or you just want to build something awesome, [we can help you get started](/home).\n\nThe API works over the HTTPS protocol, and is accessed from the `api.pandascore.co` domain.\n\n- The current endpoint is [https://api.pandascore.co](https://api.pandascore.co).\n- All data is sent and received as JSON by default.\n- Blank fields are included with `null` values instead of being omitted.\n- All timestamps are returned in ISO-8601 format\n\n### About this documentation\n\nClicking on a query parameter like `filter` or `search` will show you the available options: ![filter](/doc/images/query_param_details.jpg)\n\nYou can also click on a response to see the detailed response schema: ![response](/doc/images/response_schema.jpg)\n\n## Events hierarchy\n\nThe PandaScore API allows you to access data about eSports events by using a certain structure detailed below.\n\n**Leagues**\n\nLeagues are the top level events. They don't have a date and represent a regular competition. A League is composed of one or several series.  \nSome League of Legends leagues are: _EU LCS, NA LCS, LCK, etc._  \nSome Dota 2 leagues are: _ESL One, GESC, The International, PGL, etc._\n\n**Series**\n\nA Serie represents an occurrence of a league event.  \nThe EU LCS league has two series per year: _spring 2017, summer 2017, spring 2016, summer 2016 etc._  \nSome Dota2 Series examples would be: _Changsha Major, Open Bucharest, Frankfurt, i-League Invitational etc._\n\n**Tournaments**\n\nTournaments groups all the matches of a serie under \"stages\" and \"groups\".  \nThe tournaments of the EU LCS of summer 2017 are: _Group A, Group B, Playoffs, etc._  \nSome Dota 2 tournaments are: _Group A, Group B, Playoffs, etc._\n\n**Matches**\n\nFinally we have matches which have two players or teams (depending on the played videogame) and several games (the rounds of the match).  \nMatches of the group A in the EU LCS of summer 2017 are: _G2 vs FNC, MSF vs NIP, etc._  \nMatches of the group A in the ESL One, Genting tournamnet are: _Lower Round 1, Quarterfinal, Upper Final, etc._  \n\n**Please note that some matches may be listed as \"TBD vs TBD\" if the matchup is not announced yet, for example the date of the Final match is known but the quarterfinal is still being played.**  \n![Structure](/doc/images/structure.png)\n\n## Formats\n\n&lt;!-- The API currently supports the JSON format by default, as well as the XML format. Add the desired extension to your request URL in order to get that format. --&gt;\nThe API currently supports the JSON format by default.\n\nOther formats may be added depending on user needs.\n\n## Pagination\n\nThe Pandascore API paginates all resources on the index method.\n\nRequests that return multiple items will be paginated to 50 items by default. You can specify further pages with the `page[number]` parameter. You can also set a custom page size (up to 100) with the `page[size]` parameter.\n\nThe `Link` HTTP response header contains pagination data with `first`, `previous`, `next` and `last` raw page links when available, under the format\n\n```\nLink: &lt;https://api.pandascore.co/{Resource}?page=X+1&gt;; rel=\"next\", &lt;https://api.pandascore.co/{Resource}?page=X-1&gt;; rel=\"prev\", &lt;https://api.pandascore.co/{Resource}?page=1&gt;; rel=\"first\", &lt;https://api.pandascore.co/{Resource}?page=X+n&gt;; rel=\"last\"\n```\n\nThere is also:\n\n* A `X-Page` header field, which contains the current page.\n* A `X-Per-Page` header field, which contains the current pagination length.\n* A `X-Total` header field, which contains the total count of items across all pages.\n\n## Filtering\n\nThe `filter` query parameter can be used to filter a collection by one or several fields for one or several values. The `filter` parameter takes the field to filter as a key, and the values to filter as the value. Multiples values must be comma-separated (`,`).\n\nFor example, the following is a request for all the champions with a name matching Twitch or Brand exactly, but only with 21 armor:\n\n```\nGET /lol/champions?filter[name]=Brand,Twitch&amp;filter[armor]=21&amp;token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\n```\n\n## Range\n\nThe `range` parameter is a hash that allows filtering fields by an interval.\nOnly values between the given two comma-separated bounds will be returned. The bounds are inclusive.\n\nFor example, the following is a request for all the champions with `hp` within 500 and 1000:\n\n```\nGET /lol/champions?range[hp]=500,1000&amp;token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\n```\n\n## Search\n\nThe `search` parameter is a bit like the `filter` parameter, but it will return all results where the values **contain** the given parameter.\n\nNote: this only works on strings.\nSearching with integer values is not supported and `filter` or `range` parameters may be better suited for your needs here.\n\nFor example, to get all the champions with a name containing `\"twi\"`:\n\n```\n$ curl -sg -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' 'https://api.pandascore.co/lol/champions?search[name]=twi' | jq -S '.[].name'\n\"Twitch\"\n\"Twisted Fate\"\n```\n\n## Sorting\n\nAll index endpoints support multiple sort fields with comma-separation (`,`); the fields are applied in the order specified.\n\nThe sort order for each field is ascending unless it is prefixed with a minus (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, “-“), in which case it is descending.\n\nFor example, `GET /lol/champions?sort=attackdamage,-name&amp;token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` will return all the champions sorted by attack damage.\nAny champions with the same attack damage will then be sorted by their names in descending alphabetical order.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nDepending on your current plan, you will have a different rate limit. Your plan and your current request count [are available on your dashboard](https://pandascore.co/settings).\n\nWith the **free plan**, you have a limit of 1000 requests per hour, others plans have a limit of 4000 requests per hour. The number of remaining requests is available in the `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` response header.\n\nYour API key is included in all the examples on this page, so you can test any example right away. **Only you can see this value.**\n\n# Authentication\n\nThe authentication on the Pandascore API works with access tokens.\n\nAll developers need to [create an account](https://pandascore.co/users/sign_in) before getting started, in order to get an access token. The access token should not be shared.\n\n**Your token can be found and regenerated from [your dashboard](https://pandascore.co/settings).**\n\nThe access token can be passed in the URL with the `token` query string parameter, or in the `Authorization: Bearer` header field.\n\n&lt;!-- ReDoc-Inject: &lt;security-definitions&gt; --&gt;\n",

    "title": "Paylocity API",
    "description": "For general questions and support of the API, contact: webservices@paylocity.com\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nPaylocity Web Services API is an externally facing RESTful Internet protocol. The Paylocity API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure. OAuth 2.0 is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON.\r\nPaylocity supports v1 and v2 versions of its API endpoints. v1, while supported, won't be enhanced with additional functionality. For direct link to v1 documentation, please click [here](https://docs.paylocity.com/weblink/guides/Paylocity_Web_Services_API/v1/Paylocity_Web_Services_API.htm). For additional resources regarding v1/v2 differences and conversion path, please contact webservices@paylocity.com.\r\n\r\n##### Setup\r\n\r\nPaylocity will provide the secure client credentials and set up the scope (type of requests and allowed company numbers). You will receive the unique client id, secret, and Paylocity public key for the data encryption. The secret will expire in 365 days. \r\n* Paylocity will send you an e-mail 10 days prior to the expiration date for the current secret. If not renewed, the second e-mail notification will be sent 5 days prior to secret's expiration. Each email will contain the code necessary to renew the client secret. \r\n* You can obtain the new secret by calling API endpoint using your current not yet expired credentials and the code that was sent with the notification email. For details on API endpoint, please see Client Credentials section. \r\n* Both the current secret value and the new secret value will be recognized during the transition period. After the current secret expires, you must use the new secret. \r\n* If you were unable to renew the secret via API endpoint, you can still contact Service and they will email you new secret via secure email.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen validating the request, Paylocity API will honor the defaults and required fields set up for the company default New Hire Template as defined in Web Pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Authorization\r\n\r\nPaylocity Web Services API uses OAuth2.0 Authentication with JSON Message Format.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll requests of the Paylocity Web Services API require a bearer token which can be obtained by authenticating the client with the Paylocity Web Services API via OAuth 2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe client must request a bearer token from the authorization endpoint:\r\n\r\n\r\nauth-server for production: https://api.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token\r\n\r\n\r\nauth-server for testing: https://apisandbox.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token\r\n\r\nPaylocity reserves the right to impose rate limits on the number of calls made to our APIs. Changes to API features/functionality may be made at anytime with or without prior notice.\r\n\r\n##### Authorization Header\r\n\r\nThe request is expected to be in the form of a basic authentication request, with the \"Authorization\" header containing the client-id and client-secret. This means the standard base-64 encoded user:password, prefixed with \"Basic\" as the value for the Authorization header, where user is the client-id and password is the client-secret.\r\n\r\n##### Content-Type Header\r\n\r\nThe \"Content-Type\" header is required to be \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\".\r\n\r\n##### Additional Values\r\n\r\nThe request must post the following form encoded values within the request body:\r\n\r\n    grant_type = client_credentials\r\n    scope = WebLinkAPI\r\n\r\n##### Responses\r\n\r\nSuccess will return HTTP 200 OK with JSON content:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"access_token\": \"xxx\",\r\n      \"expires_in\": 3600,\r\n      \"token_type\": \"Bearer\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n# Encryption\r\n\r\nPaylocity uses a combination of RSA and AES cryptography. As part of the setup, each client is issued a public RSA key.\r\n\r\nPaylocity recommends the encryption of the incoming requests as additional protection of the sensitive data. Clients can opt-out of the encryption during the initial setup process. Opt-out will allow Paylocity to process unencrypted requests.\r\n\r\nThe Paylocity Public Key has the following properties:\r\n\r\n* 2048 bit key size\r\n\r\n* PKCS1 key format\r\n\r\n* PEM encoding\r\n\r\n##### Properties\r\n\r\n* key (base 64 encoded): The AES symmetric key encrypted with the Paylocity Public Key. It is the key used to encrypt the content. Paylocity will decrypt the AES key using RSA decryption and use it to decrypt the content.\r\n\r\n* iv (base 64 encoded): The AES IV (Initialization Vector) used when encrypting the content.\r\n\r\n* content (base 64 encoded): The AES encrypted request. The key and iv provided in the secureContent request are used by Paylocity for decryption of the content.\r\n\r\nWe suggest using the following for the AES:\r\n\r\n* CBC cipher mode\r\n\r\n* PKCS7 padding\r\n\r\n* 128 bit block size\r\n\r\n* 256 bit key size\r\n\r\n##### Encryption Flow\r\n\r\n* Generate the unencrypted JSON payload to POST/PUT\r\n* Encrypt this JSON payload using your _own key and IV_ (NOT with the Paylocity public key)\r\n* RSA encrypt the _key_ you used in step 2 with the Paylocity Public Key, then, base64 encode the result\r\n* Base64 encode the IV used to encrypt the JSON payload in step 2\r\n* Put together a \"securecontent\" JSON object:\r\n \r\n{\r\n  'secureContent' : {\r\n    'key' : -- RSA-encrypted & base64 encoded key from step 3,\r\n    'iv' : -- base64 encoded iv from step 4\r\n    'content' -- content encrypted with your own key from step 2, base64 encoded\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n##### Sample Example\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"secureContent\": {\r\n        \"key\": \"eS3aw6H/qzHMJ00gSi6gQ3xa08DPMazk8BFY96Pd99ODA==\",\r\n        \"iv\": \"NLyXMGq9svw0XO5aI9BzWw==\",\r\n        \"content\": \"gAEOiQltO1w+LzGUoIK8FiYbU42hug94EasSl7N+Q1w=\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n##### Sample C# Code\r\n\r\n    using Newtonsoft.Json;\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.IO;\r\n    using System.Security.Cryptography;\r\n    using System.Text;\r\n\r\n    public class SecuredContent\r\n    {\r\n      [JsonProperty(\"key\")]\r\n      public string Key { get; set; }\r\n\r\n      [JsonProperty(\"iv\")]\r\n      public string Iv { get; set; }\r\n\r\n      [JsonProperty(\"content\")]\r\n      public string Content { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class EndUserSecureRequestExample\r\n    {\r\n      public string CreateSecuredRequest(FileInfo paylocityPublicKey, string unsecuredJsonRequest)\r\n      {\r\n        string publicKeyXml = File.ReadAllText(paylocityPublicKey.FullName, Encoding.UTF8);\r\n\r\n        SecuredContent secureContent = this.CreateSecuredContent(publicKeyXml, unsecuredJsonRequest);\r\n\r\n        string secureRequest = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new { secureContent });\r\n\r\n        return secureRequest;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      private SecuredContent CreateSecuredContent(string publicKeyXml, string request)\r\n      {\r\n        using (AesCryptoServiceProvider aesCsp = new AesCryptoServiceProvider())\r\n        {\r\n          aesCsp.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;\r\n          aesCsp.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;\r\n          aesCsp.BlockSize = 128;\r\n          aesCsp.KeySize = 256;\r\n\r\n          using (ICryptoTransform crt = aesCsp.CreateEncryptor(aesCsp.Key, aesCsp.IV))\r\n          {\r\n            using (MemoryStream outputStream = new MemoryStream())\r\n            {\r\n              using (CryptoStream encryptStream = new CryptoStream(outputStream, crt, CryptoStreamMode.Write))\r\n              {\r\n                byte[] encodedRequest = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(request);\r\n                encryptStream.Write(encodedRequest, 0, encodedRequest.Length);\r\n                encryptStream.FlushFinalBlock();\r\n                byte[] encryptedRequest = outputStream.ToArray();\r\n\r\n                using (RSACryptoServiceProvider crp = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())\r\n                {\r\n                  crp.FromXmlstring(publicKeyXml);\r\n                  byte[] encryptedKey = crp.Encrypt(aesCsp.Key, false);\r\n\r\n                  return new SecuredContent()\r\n                  {\r\n                    Key = Convert.ToBase64string(encryptedKey),\r\n                    Iv = Convert.ToBase64string(aesCsp.IV),\r\n                    Content = Convert.ToBase64string(encryptedRequest)\r\n                  };\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nQuestions about using the Paylocity API?

    "title": "PDF Generator API",
    "description": "# Introduction\nPDF Generator API allows you easily generate transactional PDF documents and reduce the development and support costs by enabling your users to create and manage their document templates using a browser-based drag-and-drop document editor.\n\nThe PDF Generator API features a web API architecture, allowing you to code in the language of your choice. This API supports the JSON media type, and uses UTF-8 character encoding.\n\nYou can find our previous API documentation page with references to Simple and Signature authentication [here](https://docs.pdfgeneratorapi.com/legacy).\n\n## Base URL\nThe base URL for all the API endpoints is `https://us1.pdfgeneratorapi.com/api/v3`\n\nFor example\n* `https://us1.pdfgeneratorapi.com/api/v3/templates`\n* `https://us1.pdfgeneratorapi.com/api/v3/workspaces`\n* `https://us1.pdfgeneratorapi.com/api/v3/templates/123123`\n\n## Editor\nPDF Generator API comes with a powerful drag & drop editor that allows to create any kind of document templates, from barcode labels to invoices, quotes and reports. You can find tutorials and videos from our [Support Portal](https://support.pdfgeneratorapi.com).\n* [Component specification](https://support.pdfgeneratorapi.com/en/category/components-1ffseaj/)\n* [Expression Language documentation](https://support.pdfgeneratorapi.com/en/category/expression-language-q203pa/)\n* [Frequently asked questions and answers](https://support.pdfgeneratorapi.com/en/category/qanda-1ov519d/)\n\n## Definitions\n\n### Organization\nOrganization is a group of workspaces owned by your account.\n\n### Workspace\nWorkspace contains templates. Each workspace has access to their own templates and organization default templates.\n\n### Master Workspace\nMaster Workspace is the main/default workspace of your Organization. The Master Workspace identifier is the email you signed up with.\n\n### Default Template\nDefault template is a template that is available for all workspaces by default. You can set the template access type under Page Setup. If template has \"Organization\" access then your users can use them from the \"New\" menu in the Editor.\n\n### Data Field\nData Field is a placeholder for the specific data in your JSON data set. In this example JSON you can access the buyer name using Data Field `{paymentDetails::buyerName}`. The separator between depth levels is :: (two colons). When designing the template you don’t have to know every Data Field, our editor automatically extracts all the available fields from your data set and provides an easy way to insert them into the template.\n```\n{\n    \"documentNumber\": 1,\n    \"paymentDetails\": {\n        \"method\": \"Credit Card\",\n        \"buyerName\": \"John Smith\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 1,\n            \"name\": \"Item one\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n# Authentication\nThe PDF Generator API uses __JSON Web Tokens (JWT)__ to authenticate all API requests. These tokens offer a method to establish secure server-to-server authentication by transferring a compact JSON object with a signed payload of your account’s API Key and Secret.\nWhen authenticating to the PDF Generator API, a JWT should be generated uniquely by a __server-side application__ and included as a __Bearer Token__ in the header of each request.\n\n## Legacy Simple and Signature authentication\nYou can find our legacy documentation for Simple and Signature authentication [here](https://docs.pdfgeneratorapi.com/legacy).\n\n<SecurityDefinitions />\n\n## Accessing your API Key and Secret\nYou can find your __API Key__ and __API Secret__ from the __Account Settings__ page after you login to PDF Generator API [here](https://pdfgeneratorapi.com/login).\n\n## Creating a JWT\nJSON Web Tokens are composed of three sections: a header, a payload (containing a claim set), and a signature. The header and payload are JSON objects, which are serialized to UTF-8 bytes, then encoded using base64url encoding.\n\nThe JWT's header, payload, and signature are concatenated with periods (.). As a result, a JWT typically takes the following form:\n```\n{Base64url encoded header}.{Base64url encoded payload}.{Base64url encoded signature}\n```\n\nWe recommend and support libraries provided on [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). While other libraries can create JWT, these recommended libraries are the most robust.\n\n### Header\nProperty `alg` defines which signing algorithm is being used. PDF Generator API users HS256.\nProperty `typ` defines the type of token and it is always JWT.\n```\n{\n  \"alg\": \"HS256\",\n  \"typ\": \"JWT\"\n}\n```\n\n### Payload\nThe second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims  or the pieces of information being passed about the user and any metadata required.\nIt is mandatory to specify the following claims:\n* issuer (`iss`): Your API key\n* subject (`sub`): Workspace identifier\n* expiration time (`exp`): Timestamp (unix epoch time) until the token is valid. It is highly recommended to set the exp timestamp for a short period, i.e. a matter of seconds. This way, if a token is intercepted or shared, the token will only be valid for a short period of time.\n\n```\n{\n  \"iss\": \"ad54aaff89ffdfeff178bb8a8f359b29fcb20edb56250b9f584aa2cb0162ed4a\",\n  \"sub\": \"demo.example@actualreports.com\",\n  \"exp\": 1586112639\n}\n```\n\n### Signature\nTo create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.\n```\nHMACSHA256(\n    base64UrlEncode(header) + \".\" +\n    base64UrlEncode(payload),\n    API_SECRET)\n```\n\n### Putting all together\nThe output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots. The following shows a JWT that has the previous header and payload encoded, and it is signed with a secret.\n```\neyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJhZDU0YWFmZjg5ZmZkZmVmZjE3OGJiOGE4ZjM1OWIyOWZjYjIwZWRiNTYyNTBiOWY1ODRhYTJjYjAxNjJlZDRhIiwic3ViIjoiZGVtby5leGFtcGxlQGFjdHVhbHJlcG9ydHMuY29tIn0.SxO-H7UYYYsclS8RGWO1qf0z1cB1m73wF9FLl9RCc1Q\n\n// Base64 encoded header: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9\n// Base64 encoded payload: eyJpc3MiOiJhZDU0YWFmZjg5ZmZkZmVmZjE3OGJiOGE4ZjM1OWIyOWZjYjIwZWRiNTYyNTBiOWY1ODRhYTJjYjAxNjJlZDRhIiwic3ViIjoiZGVtby5leGFtcGxlQGFjdHVhbHJlcG9ydHMuY29tIn0\n// Signature: SxO-H7UYYYsclS8RGWO1qf0z1cB1m73wF9FLl9RCc1Q\n```\n\n## Testing with JWTs\nYou can create a temporary token in [Account Settings](https://pdfgeneratorapi.com/account/organization) page after you login to PDF Generator API. The generated token uses your email address as the subject (`sub`) value and is valid for __5 minutes__.\nYou can also use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to generate test tokens for your API calls. These test tokens should never be used in production applications.\n*  *  *  *  *\n\n# Libraries and SDKs\n## Postman Collection\nWe have created a [Postman](https://www.postman.com) Collection so you can easily test all the API endpoints wihtout developing and code.

If you are doing a standard integration, there's a really easy [Javascript integration](https://help.receptive.io/hc/en-us/articles/209221969-How-to-integrate-Receptive-with-your-app) that you should know about before you go to the effort of building your own integration.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAPI calls generally need to be authenticated. Generate an API Key at https://feedback.pendo.io/app/#/vendor/settings?section=integrate. This key should then be added to every request as a request header named 'auth-token' (preferred), or as a query parameter named 'auth-token'.\n\n## Endpoint\n\nAPI endpoint is https://api.feedback.eu.pendo.io / https://api.feedback.us.pendo.io depending where your datacenter is located.\n\n## Notes\n\nAPI endpoints are being added to this documentation as needed by customers. If you don't see an endpoint you need please contact support and if it exists we'll publish the docs here. The 'try it out' feature on this documentation page will probably be blocked by your browser because the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header has its value set by the Feedback server depending on your hostname.\n\n## Generating client code\n\nThis documentation is automatically generated from an OpenAPI spec available [here](http://apidoc.receptive.io/receptive.swagger.json).

    "title": "PhantAuth",
    "description": "Random User Generator + OpenID Connect Provider. Like Lorem Ipsum, but for user accounts and authentication.\n\nThe PhantAuth API documentation is available on the following API documentation sites:\n\n- [apiary](https://phantauth.docs.apiary.io) (primary source)\n\n- [speca](https://speca.io/phantauth/phantauth)\n\n- [PhantAuth Developer Portal](https://www.phantauth.net/api)\n\n### TL;DR\n\n**PhantAuth was designed to simplify testing for applications using OpenID Connect authentication by making use of random generated users.**\n\nendpoint  | address\n--------- | -------\nissuer    | https://phantauth.net\ndiscovery | https://phantauth.net/.well-known/openid-configuration\n\ncredential    | value\n------------- | -----\nclient_id     | test.client\nclient_secret | UTBcWwt5\n\n## OpenID Connect\n\nThe OpenID Connect Provider of PhantAuth supports the flows listed in the OpenID Connect specifications (Hybrid, Implicit, Authorization Code), as well as the Resource Owner Password grant type, specified in the OAuth 2.0 specifications. PhantAuth as an OpenID Connect Provider can be integrated with a variety of web applications, mobil applications, and  backend applications. The integration can be either direct, as in the case of the OpenID Connect Provider, or through an authentication integration service, as in the case of Auth0 or Azure Active Directory B2C. To learn more, please go to chapter [Integration](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/integration).\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Direct OpenID Connect integration](https://www.phantauth.net/test/oidc)\n\n- [Auth0 Social Connections integration](https://www.phantauth.net/test/auth0)\n\n- [Azure Active Directory B2C integration](https://www.phantauth.net/test/azure)\n\n## Random User\n\nThe random user generator of PhantAuth can also be used separately, independent of the OpenID Connect Provider. You can generate an optional number of test users. In the knowledge of their user name, the data of the generated users can be regenerated at any time (OpenID Connect *sub* claim). The generated users have a unique, operational, disposable email address, a profile picture selected from one of the multiple pools of pictures, and the usual profile data. Custom email addresses and profile pictures may also be added. The random user generator of PhantAuth can be fully customized. Additionally, you can link an external generator to the application. For details,please go to chapter [Generator](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/generator).\n\nTest pages:\n\n- [Default Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/test/user) (embedded generator)\n\n- [Greek Gods Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_gods/test/user) (embedded generator working from a Google Sheet)\n\n- [Faker Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_faker/test/user) (external generator using Javascript Faker library)\n\n- [Chance Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_chance/test/user) (external generator using Javascript Chance library)\n\n- [Casual Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_casual/test/user) (external generator using Javascript Casual library)\n\n- [Randomuser Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_randomuser/test/user) (client side generator using https://randomuser.me)\n\n- [uinames Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_uinames/test/user) (client side generator using https://uinames.com)\n\n- [Mockaroo Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_mockaroo/test/user) (client side generator using https://mockaroo.com)\n\nEvery random generated user has a profile page, which contains their profile data in a simple one-page format.\n\nProfile examples:\n\n- [Random Profile](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe.black)\n\n- [Random Greek God Profile](https://phantauth.net/_gods/%7Ezeus)\n\n- [Random Faker Profile](https://phantauth.net/_faker/%7Eharry.houdini)\n\n- [Random Chance Profile](https://phantauth.net/_chance/%7Epeter.pan)\n\n- [Random Casual Profile](https://phantauth.net/_casual/%7Ejohn.smith)\n\n## CodeSandbox\n\nThe use of the random user generator and the direct integration of  the OpenID Connect is demonstrated through a set of CodeSandbox samples. The sample applications are run directly from CodeSandbox, so the source code is easy to view, edit, and test.\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Random User Generator usage exampe](https://4xyj8lw394.codesandbox.io/)\n\n- [OpenID Connect direct integration exampe](https://8z77681269.codesandbox.io/)\n\n## Tenants\n\nThe PhantAuth is extremely versatile and customizable. You can use your own random user service, or generate users from an external .csv file or Google Sheet. You can use a set of Bootstrap themes to tailor the look and feel of the profile, morover, you can fundamentally change the same look and feel by the use of your own HTML templates. To find out more, please go to chapter [Tenant](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/tenant).\n\nTo customize the application, you need to use one or more so-called tenants. A tenant can be consiered as an independent PhantAuth service. A tenant has its own random user generator endpoints and OpenID Connect endpoints.\n\nThe tenants can be organised into so-called domains. Practically, a domain is a DNS zone, which contains the settings of the given tenant(s). The tenants as well as the domain can be configured by the use of DNS TXT records.\n\nIn addition to the default tenant, the PhantAuth domain contains some sample tenants, which are primarily designed to demonstrate customizability, a range of hosting possibilities, and the links to external services. In most cases, using the [default tenant](https://phantauth.net) is enough.\n\n- [PhantAuth Default](https://phantauth.net) - default tenant, based on a Java Fairy library\n\n- [Greek Gods](https://phantauth.net/_gods) - based on a Google Sheet document\n\n- [PhantAuth Faker](https://phantauth.net/_faker) - based on a Javascript Faker library, hosted at https://now.sh\n\n- [PhantAuth Chance](https://phantauth.net/_chance) - based on a Javascript Chance library, hosted at https://now.sh\n\n- [PhantAuth Casual](https://phantauth.net/_casual) - based on a Javascript Casual library, hosted at https://webtask.io\n\n- [RANDOM USER](https://phantauth.net/_randomuser) - based on https://randomuser.me service\n\n- [uinames](https://phantauth.net/_uinames) - based on https://uinames.com service\n\n- [Mockaroo](https://phantauth.net/_mockaroo) - based on  https://mockaroo.com service\n\nAnyone can create a domain and the tenants. Sharing the tenants is facilitated by the [PhantAuth Shared Domain](https://shared.phantauth.net). A shared domain is connected to the [phantauth.cf](http://phantauth.cf) DNS zone, where anyone can create tenant configuration nodes by the use of the [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/) service.\n\n### Concept\n\nThe internal structure of PhantAuth is modular enough to allow certain elements to be customized or even replaced. The customized PhantAuth instances can be considered as separate services, which are independent from the original one. For the sake of simplicity, the customized PhantAuth instances will be called **tenants**.\n\nThe customized PhantAuth instances (tenants) have a different URL from that of the default tenant. For technological and cloud hosting purposes, it is advised that only the beginning of the path component of these URLs differs from the default PhantAuth URL. Similarly, the path component of a tenant URL should start with a low line character (\"_\"). So the general format of a tenant URL is:\n\n```\nhttps://phantauth.net/_TENANT\n```\n\nwhere `TENANT` is the name of the tenant. The tenant name is a DNS domain name at the same time, which may lack `.phantauth.net` or `.phantauth.cf` from the end.\n\n### DNS for configuration\n\nWhen desiging PhantAuth, the aim is that PhantAuth can run without a database, and it is configurable by the users. This can be achieved if for the purpose of storing the tenant configuration, the system uses the special TXT records of the Domain Name System (DNS), in compliance with the [RFC 6763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763) specifications. So the tenant name is one or more DNS TXT records. These TXT records contain the configuration properties in NAME=VALUE format.\n\nThis allows anyone to create their own tenants by creating a DNS domain and the TXT records in that domain. [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com), a service provider, allows you to register some top-level domains (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq) free charge. The domain registered this way can be managed on the online interface of Freenom or transferred to an other free service provider offering a more convenient DNS name server (e.g. [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)). Additionally, [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/) allows you to create DNS records within a second- or third level domain that is privately owned or shared with a community. In this case, you are advised to create the entries within the `phantauth.cf` domain, because here you can omit the `.phantauth.cf` from the tenant name in the URL. This means that a tenant with a name of `mytenant.phantauth.cf` can be referred to in the shorther `https://phantauth.net/_mytenant` format, rather than the longer `https://phantauth.net/_mytenant.phantauth.cf` URL . Similar to `.phantauth.cf`, the `phantauth.net` can be omitted, thus the officially supported and the example tenants can be referred to by their short names (e.g. https://phantauth.net/_faker).\n\nIn a nutshell, to create a tenant, you have the following options:\n\n- With TXT records in a domain registered at Freenom, either on the online interface of Freenom or that of another free DNS service provider (e.g. CloudFlare).\n\n- With TXT records created in a second- or third level domain shared with a community, by using FreeDNS.\n\n- With TXT records created in your own existing DNS domain, by the use of an any DNS software.\n\n### Parameters\n\nThe below table contains a summary of the tenant parameters having an effect on the operation of the tenants.\n\nProperty | Description\n--- | ---\n[name](#name) | the displayed name of the tenant\n[flags](#flags) | generator flags having an effect on the login page\n[theme](#theme) | the address of the Bootstrap theme\n[template](#template) | the address of the HTML page templates\n[factory](#factory) | the address of the external user generator\n[depot](#depot) | the address of the external user database\n[sheet](#sheet) | the identifier of the Google Sheets document containing the user database\n[script](#script) | the JavaScript URL inserted in the HTML pages\n[summary](#summary) | a one-line summary of the tenant\n[about](#about) | a detailed description of the tenant\n[attribution](#attribution) | the specifications of the external source\n[logo](#logo) | the logo of the tenant\n[favicon](#favicon) | the favicon of the tenant's web pages\n\n#### name\n\nThe displayed name of the tenant is defined in the `name` parameter. In lack of such a name, the tenant's DNS name is displayed. This name appears in the address bar of the tenant's webpages.\n\n#### flags\n\nThis parameter contains the flags that affect the operation of a tenant (see [Flags](generator.md#flags)). Currently, the flags affecting the team size are used in the login screen. If any of the flags is a team size flag, you can select the user from a list in the login screen, rather than using an input field. It can take the following values:\n\n- tiny\n\n- small\n\n- medium\n\n- large\n\n#### theme\n\nThe HTML page templates of a tenant are created by the use of the Bootstrap library. This allows you to customize the layout and the colours of the pages by using external Bootstrap CSS files. The `theme` parameter contains the URL of the Bootstrap CSS file used in the pages. It is optional; in lack of such a parameter, the tenant's HTML pages have the default layout provided in the [PhantAuth developer portal](https://www.phantauth.net).\n\n#### template\n\nThe place of the HTML page templates of a tenant is specified by the `template` parameter. The value of the parameter is n [RFC 6570 - URI temaplate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) expression. The URI template receives the page name in a `resource` parameter.\n\nThe default value of the `template` parameter:\n\n```\nhttps://default.phantauth.net{/resource}\n```\n\nThe `resource` URI template parameter may take the following values:\n\nValue | Description\n--- | ---\ntenant.html | the tenant's webpage; it contains a short description and the entry points of the tenant \nuser.html | the user's profile page\nlogin.html | the login page used for signing in\nconsent.html | the content page used for signing in\nteam.html | the profile page of the user group\nclient.html | the profile page of a client\nfleet.html | the profile page of the client group\npolicy.html | the client's privacy policy\ntos.html | a client's terms of service\ntest.html | a login test page of the user generator and OpenID Connect\n\nIf you use your own template, the pages are fully customizable. The templates use a template engine called [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/), which provides flexible template options. The source of the default template is available in the [phantauth-default](https://github.com/phantauth/phantauth-default) GitHub repository. If you wish to create your own templates, you are advised to produce them from these templates.\n\n#### factory\n\nPhantAuth allows you to use your own random resource (user, team) generator. To do so, you need to provide its address in the `factory` tenant parameter. The value of the parameter is an [RFC 6570 - URI temaplate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) expression. The URI template receives the type of the object (user, team) to be generated in the `kind` parameter, and the identifier of the object to be generated in the `name` parameter.\n\n#### factories\n\nIn the `factories` parameter, you can specify the resource types that can be generated by the external generator set in the `factory` parameter. It takes the value of one or more strings from the following: `user`, `team`.\n\n#### depot\n\nInstead of generating a user and team resource, you can randomly select them from a pre-created inventory. In this case, the URL of the CSV file containing the resources can be specified in the `depot` parameter. The value of the parameter is an [RFC 6570 - URI temaplate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) expression. The URI template receives the type of the object (user, team) to be generated in the `kind` parameter.\n\nThe first line of the CSV file contains the resource property names, the following lines, on the other hand, contain the relevant data.\nIn the case of nested properties, a \".\" character separates the elements of the property name (e.g. address.formatted).\n\n#### depots\n\nIn the `depots` parameter, you can specify the purpose of the external source set in the `depot` parameter. It takes the value of one or more strings from the following: `user`, `team`.\n\n#### sheet\n\nYou can randomly select the user data from a Google Sheets document. In the `sheet` parameter, you can specify the identifier of a public Google Sheets document. The first row of the table contains the user property names, the following rows contain the relating data. In the case of nested properties, a \".\" character is used to separate the elements of the property name (e.g. address.formatted).\n\nThe tenant named `gods` is an example for the use of the `sheet` parameter. It provides the user data in a [public Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xa4mRcLWroJr2vUDhrJXGBcobYmpS8fNZxFpXw-M9DY/) document. In this case, the identifier of the sheet is `1Xa4mRcLWroJr2vUDhrJXGBcobYmpS8fNZxFpXw-M9DY`, and the associated TXT record is:\n\n```\ngods    120 IN  TXT \"sheet=1Xa4mRcLWroJr2vUDhrJXGBcobYmpS8fNZxFpXw-M9DY\"\n```\n\n#### script\n\nYou can automatically insert a custom JavaScript file in the login.html, consent.html, and test.html pages. The URL of this file can be specified in the `script` parameter. By inserting a custom JavaScript file, you can also integrate a client-side random user generator.\n\n#### summary\n\nYou can provide a short, one-line description, a watchword for the tenant in the `summary` parameter. It appears on the tenant's startup page and all the pages that contain a list of available tenants.\n\n#### about\n\nTo provide a detailed description of the tenant, use the `about` parameter. If it takes the value of a URL, the description is downloaded from the given URL; otherwise the value is the description itself. The description may have markdown formatting.\n\n#### attribution\n\nIt is an external data source. If you use a random user generator, you can specify the attribution in the `attribution` parameter. The attribution may have markdown formatting, that is, you can highlight any element or provide a link to an external source:\n\n```\nrandomuser  120 IN  TXT \"attribution=User data generated using [RANDOM USER GENERATOR](https://randomuser.me/).\"\n```\n\n#### logo\n\nIt is the URL of the tenant's logo. The image at this address appears in the address bar of the tenant's webpages.\n\n#### favicon\n\nUse the `favicon` parameter to provide the URL of the favicon. The image at this address appears as a shortcut icon in the browser when a user visits the tenant's webpages.\n\n### Examples\n\nPhantAuth offers several examples for creating a custom tenant. They are ready-to-use tenants, although primarily created to show examples for customization.\n\n#### faker\n\nA [PhantAuth Faker](https://phantauth.net/_faker) tenant contains a generator built on the JavaScript Faker library.

If you find this service useful and can afford, please make a small donation as a contribution to the operation costs (domain registration, service hosting, etc.)\n\n[Donate on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/Q5Q0T7C7) | [Donate on Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/szkiba/donate) | [Donate on PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VXLCJ3EZRAE7G&source=url)\n\n## Generator\n\nThe basic concept of PhantAuth is that it generates data in a random but deterministic way. To achieve this goal, a so-called pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is used. Each object type has an identifier (login name for user, client_id for client, etc.) By using a given hash algorithm, the value of the pseudorandom generator seed is produced from this identifier. Then, every property of the given object is generated with the pseudorandom generator started from this seed value. Taking advantage of the special feature of the pseudorandom number generator, also called as deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), that is, it generates the same random value series started from the same seed, the identifier clearly defines the object generated from it. That is, by the use of an identifier and generator, you can regenarate the properties of a given object at any time.\n\nBased on the above concept, PhantAuth is absolutely stateless, and no storage medium is necessary. So, a randomly selected login name will \"exist\", and the properties of the \"associated\" user can be generated.\n\n### Identifier\n\nIn brief, an object is defined by its identifier. The name of the identifier of a user or client object is `sub` or `client_id` used in the OpenID Connect specifications. The name of the identifier property of other PhantAuth-specific objects that are not included in the specifications is `sub`.\n\nThe identifier may contain any character.\n\n### Customization\n\nSometimes you may want to customize the properties generated from the identifier. Although the identifier may contain any character, and its structure is optional, you can customize the generated values if a certain structure is used.\n\n#### Flags\n\nYou can use a variety of flags to customize or give the parameters of certain object properties (user, client, etc.). The flags can be grouped by their effect on the generation of the properties. Basically, a flag is a keyword. You can set more than one flags to affect the generation of a variety of properties at the same time. To separate the flags from one another and the rest of the identifier, you need to use a semicolon `;`:\n\n```\njoe;female;kitten\n```\n\nIn the above example, the user generated by the user generator is female, and her avatar is a randomly selected sketched kitten avatar. The other features are deterministically generated from the name \"joe\", that is, their values are not affected by the two flags. The [profile page](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe%3bfemale%3bkitten) of this example can be found [here](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe%3bfemale%3bkitten).\n\nPlease note that the flags form part of the identifier, as a different flag allows you to generate a different object.\n\n##### User gender flags\n\nThe following flags modify the gender of the generated user.\n\nFlag | Description\n--- | ---\nmale | The `gender` property of the generated user is male, independent of the user's name\nfemale | The `gender` property of the generated user is female, independent of the user's name\nguess | The `gender` property is defined on the basis of the generated user's given name (default)\nnogender | The generated user doesn't have a `gender` property\n\n##### User avatar flags\n\nThe following flags modify the generated avatar image.\n\nAvatar | Flag | Description\n--- | --- | ---\n![](data:image/jpeg;base64,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)

| fractal | [Electric Sheep](https://electricsheep.org/) fractal as a logo\n\n##### `Group` size flags\n\nThe following flag modify the sizes of the generated team (group of users) and fleet (group of clients).\n\nFlag | Size\n--- | ---\ntiny | 5 (default)\nsmall | 10\nmedium | 25\nlarge | 50\nhuge | 100\n\n#### Name\n\nIn most cases, the generated objects have a full name, which is generated from the identifier. Instead of being generated, the full name can be produced from the identifier, if the identifier contains at least one period (`.`) or space (` `) character. In such cases, these characters play the role of separator between the parts of the full name (e.g. family name, given name). That is, the full name isn't randomly generated from the identifier but, by taking the separator characters into account,  it is produced from the single parts of the full name (with capitalised initial letters). For this purpose, it is advised to use a period character, rather than a space character.\n\n```\njoe.black;sketch\n```\n\nIn the above example: The full name of the user generated by the user generator is *Joe Black* (and his avatar is a skecthed profile avatar). The [profile page](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe.black%3bsketch) of this example can be found [here](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe.black%3bsketch).\n\n#### Picture\n\nIn most cases, the generated objects have an image (avatar for a user, logo for a client), which is generated from the identifier. The *flags* determine which pre-defined inventory the image comes from (see [flags](#flags)). It can be further customized by the use of [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com).\n\nEach object has a generated unique email address (`email` for a user, `logo_email` for any other objects). To customize the image of a given object, you need to assign the gravatar image to this email address. By default, an object has a gravatar image, and the generated image is the default value of the gravatar URL only. In other words, as soon as you create a gravatar image to a given email address, that image will appear as the image associated with the given object.\n\n#### Email\n\nA disposable, operational email address suitable for receiving incoming emails is generated to each object. You can use your own email address (e.g. a previously set test email address) instead of a generated email address, if you prefer. In this case, the identifier contains an email address. Consequently, the image associated with the given object is the gravatar image assigned to the email address contained in the identifier.\n\n```\nivan.test.szkiba@spam4.me\n```\n\nIn the above example: The email address of the user generated by the user generator is *ivan.test.szkiba@spam4.me* (and his name is *Ivan Test Szkiba*). The [profile page](https://phantauth.net/%7Eivan.test.szkiba%40spam4.me) of this example can be found [here](https://phantauth.net/%7Eivan.test.szkiba%40spam4.me).\n\n### Custom Generators\n\nPhantAuth can use external data sources and generators as well. The only restriction is that the external generator has to be deterministic. This means that even if called several times, it has to generate the same object to the same identifier.\n\nA special case of external generators is if an external data source is used. In such cases, the properties of a given object can be provided in a comma separated value (CSV) file or a Google Sheets document.\n\nThe external data sources and generators can be defined by the use of so-called [tenants](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/tenant). To learn more, please go to chapter [Tenant](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/tenant).",

    "description": "\nHereafter is the documentation of the private API of [Pims: Pointages Intelligents pour le Monde du Spectacle](https://pims.io). This API is designed for 3rd-party softwares, editors and partners. Its main purpose is to give access the core data of a Pims customer (i.e. events, ticket counts and promotions).\n\n## Authentication\nThe API uses [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), meaning you will need a username and password to get authorized.\n\nAs each customer in Pims has its own domain (e.g. caramba.pims.io, gdp.pims.io...), each credentials will be valid for one domain/customer only. If you need dedicated credentials for one domain, please contact us. (In any case, we will need an explicit agreement from the customer before we create these credentials.)\n\n<div class=\"info\">\nTo make your life easy, you can try all endpoints with the public credentials below, pointing to our [demo domain](https://demo.pims.io):\n  <ul>\n    <li>Base path: `https://demo.pims.io/api`</li>\n    <li>Username: `demo`</li>\n    <li>Password: `q83792db2GCvgYVdKpU3yG3R`</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n## Response format\nThe API returns JSON and matches the [HAL specification](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html). The `Content-Type` of each response will be `application/hal+json`, unless an error occurs.\n\nPlease note that this documentation describes all responses “as if” they were plain JSON. The specificities of HAL are ignored on purpose, in order to remain compact and avoid repetition.\n<div style=\"-webkit-column-count: 2; -moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2; -webkit-column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0; -moz-column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0; column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0;\">\n\t<div style=\"display: inline-block; width:100%;\">\n\t\t<strong>So when you read in the doc:</strong>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n\t<span class=\"token string\">\"id\"</span>: <span class=\"token number\">123</span>,\n\t<span class=\"token string\">\"property1\"</span>: <span class=\"token string\">\"Lorem ipsum\"</span>,\n\t<span class=\"token string\">\"object\"</span>: {\n\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"id\"</span>: <span class=\"token number\">456</span>,\n\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"property2\"</span>: <span class=\"token number\">7.89</span>\n\t}\n}</code></pre>\n\t</div>\n\t<div style=\"display: inline-block; width:100%;\">\n\t\t<strong>... you'll get in the Real World®:</strong>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n\t<span class=\"token string\">\"id\"</span>: <span class=\"token number\">123</span>,\n\t<span class=\"token string\">\"property2\"</span>: <span class=\"token string\">\"Lorem ipsum\"</span>,\n\t<span class=\"token string\">\"_embedded\"</span>: {\n\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"object\"</span>: {\n\t\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"id\"</span>: <span class=\"token number\">456</span>,\n\t\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"property2\"</span>: <span class=\"token number\">7.89</span>,\n\t\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"_links\"</span>: {\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"self\"</span>: {\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"href\"</span>: <span class=\"token string\">\"https://api.mydomain.com/other-item/456\"</span>\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t<span class=\"token string\">\"_links\"</span>: {\n\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"self\"</span>: {\n\t\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"href\"</span>: <span class=\"token string\">\"https://api.mydomain.com/item/123\"</span>\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}</code></pre>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n### Errors\nErrors return JSON too and tries to match the [Problem Details for HTTP APIs specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807). If it does not match this spec, that's either a bug or a compatibility issue. Please contact us to solve the problem.\n\nThe `Content-Type` of errors will be `application/problem+json`. The content will match the following JSON:\n```json\n{\n\t\"type\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10\",\n    \"title\": \"Not Found\",\n\t\"status\": 404,\n    \"detail\": \"Entity not found\"\n}\n```\n\n## Versioning\nThe API is fully versionned, using an URL-versioning scheme: `https://demo.pims.io/api/v1/events`, `https://demo.pims.io/api/v2/events`,...\n\nThe version part of the URL is optional, and will be completed with the last stable version if omitted.\n\n## Pagination\nAll responses corresponding to a collection of resources (e.g. `/venues` or `/series/:id/events`) are paginated. When so, you will only get the first 25 resources you asked for.\n\nIf you need to get more resources in one call, you can use the `page_size` query parameter. E.g. `/venues?page_size=50` to get the 50 first venues.\n\nAlso note that with HAL, the navigation in paginated responses is a piece of cake, as you can see below:\n```json\n{\n\t\"_links\": {\n\t\t\"self\": {\n\t\t\t\"href\": \"https://demo.pims.io/api/v1/events?page=1\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"first\": {\n\t\t\t\"href\": \"https://demo.pims.io/api/v1/events\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"last\": {\n\t\t\t\"href\": \"https://demo.pims.io/api/v1/events?page=14\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"next\": {\n\t\t\t\"href\": \"https://demo.pims.io/api/v1/events?page=2\"\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\t\"_embedded\": {\n \t\t... // data content goes here\n\t},\n\t\"page_count\": 14,\n\t\"page_size\": 25,\n\t\"total_items\": 331,\n\t\"page\": 1\n}\n```\n\n## Filtering and sorting\nEvery textual filter (e.g. `/events?label=U2`) and/or sort (e.g. `/events?sort=label`) performed with the API uses UTF8_UNICODE_CI collation, meaning it is:\n- Case insensitive: “Chloé” will be considered the same as “CHLOÉ”;\n- Diacritic insensitive: “Chloé” will be considered the same as “Chloe”.\n\nWhen performing a sort, it will always be *ascending* by default. To make it *descending*, just use a minus sign (`-`) in front of the parameter value (e.g. `/events?sort=-label`).\n\n## I18n\nIn responses, some labels can be translated (e.g. promotion types, event input types, etc.). These translatable labels are clearly indicated in the documentation below.\n\nBy default, they will be displayed in English, but you can change this behaviour via the `Accept-Language` header. E.g., use `fr` as a value for French.\n\n## PHP SDK\nWe provide a simple yet convenient SDK for the PHP language, see [the Github page of the project](https://github.com/pimssas/pims-api-client-php).\n\n## And now?\nGeneraly, you will start by [fetching one or more events](#tag/Events). An <span class=\"definition\">event</span> can be anything that occurs in one venue at one given date and time: a concert, a play, a match, a conference, etc. Additionnally, you can explore the [series](#tag/Series): a <span class=\"definition\">series</span> is just a group of events (e.g. a tour or a festival).\n\nOnce you retrieved the events you were interested in, you can look for the sales (<span class=\"definition\">ticket counts</span>):\n- Get a quick overview with [`/events/:id/ticket-counts`](#operation/fetchAllTicketCounts)\n- Or get a full insight by calling these endpoints:\n    1. [`/events/:id/categories`](#operation/fetchAllEventsCategories)\n    2. [`/events/:id/channels`](#operation/fetchAllEventsChannels)\n    3. [`/events/:id/ticket-counts/detailed`](#operation/fetchAllDetailedTicketCounts)\n\nEventually, you may also want to fetch the [promotions](#tag/Promotions). A <span class=\"definition\">promotion</span> can be anything meant to leverage the sales: ads, marketing campaigns, buzz or news around the event, etc. A promotion can be linked to any combination of events and/or series.",

Does it use basic auth?\nDoes it expect a certain cookie or header?\nThese parameters are all configured in the *target*'s *site*.\n\n\nWe need to ensure that only allowed web applications are scanned.\nTherefore, we must verify that you have control of any site you wish to include.\nThis can be done by:\n  * Placing a file on a well-known location, on the site's server;\n  * Creating specific DNS records.\n\n\n### Asset\n\nAn *asset* is very similar to a *site*. The difference is that it is a domain instead\nof a URL. Additionally, an *asset* has no login or basic auth support.\nYou can still have custom cookies and headers per *asset*.\n\nAs with the *site*, you will need to prove an *asset*'s ownership. We have added some\nrules to make your life easier, if you already have verified\na *site* and the domains match, the validation is fast-tracked.\n\n### Scans\n\nThis is what you're here for.\nAfter configuring your *target*, you will want to run *scans* against it.\nYou can either start a one off scan, or schedule one for later - recurring\nor not.\n\nDuring the *scan*, we will spider and run several modules to check for\nsecurity issues, which we call *findings*.\nYou can check the *findings* even before a scan ends.\nIf everything goes well, the scan will complete and that is it.\n\nWith some *findings*, our automated processes may have difficulties\ndetermining if it is a false positive or a legitimate issue.\nIn these instances, a scan will be marked as under review, and we will\nfurther analyze the finding before making a decision.\nWe will only show findings that, for some degree of confidence, are true\npositives.\nA finding that we are not sure of will never be displayed.\n\nAs much as we try to prevent it, a *scan* (or a sub-module) can malfunction.\nIf this happens, a *scan* is marked as:\n  * \"failed\": the problem was irrecoverable;\n  * \"completed with errors\": some module failed but the scan itself completed.\n\nDuring a scan, we try to determine what *frameworks* you are using\nand add this information to the *site* and *asset* objects discussed\npreviously.\n\n\n### Findings\n\nThe last core concept is the *finding*, this is a security issue that\nwe have found during our scans.\nIf the same issue is found in a new scan it will not open a new finding but\nupdate the previous.\n\nA *finding* will have a lot of information about the issue.\nNamely, where it was found, URL, insertion point (e.g. cookie), parameter,\nand method.\nEvidence we gathered, and the full request and response that we used.\nSugestions of how to go about fixing it.\nA full description of the vulnerability is also present in the\n*definition* property.\nWe also assign a severity and calculate the CVSS score for each.\n\nBesides all this, there are also actions that you can perform on a *finding*.\nYou can assign it to one user, leave comments for your team or add labels,\nand reduce or increase the severity.\n\nIf you don't plan on fixing the *finding* and accept the risk, or you think\nwe reported a false positive, you can mark the finding to reflect that.\n",

    "title": "ContentDepot",
    "description": "ContentDepot hosts a range of API’s that allow clients to manage, discover, and obtain content. The API spans many parts of the ContentDepot functionality including MetaPub (a.k.a. metadata distribution) and content management.\n\n## MetaPub\n\nMetaPub collects, normalizes and distributes publicly available program, episode, and piece metadata through the public radio system. Backed by ContentDepot and its data model, MetaPub allows producers to supply metadata through various methods:\n\n1. MetaPub Agents that collect producer metadata by \"crawling\" existing public feeds (e.g. C24, BBC) or the producer's production system (e.g. ATC, ME, TED Radio Hour).\n2. Manually enter metadata in the ContentDepot Portal on each program and episode.\n3. Publish/push the metadata to the MetaPub upload API and execute an ingest job.\n\nMetaPub then distributes this data to stations through an electronic program guide (EPG model) for display on various listener devices such as smart phones, tablets, web streams, HD radios, RDBS enabled FM radios, and more. The EPG format is based on the RadioDNS specifications.\n\n### RadioDNS\n\nThe RadioDNS Service and Programme Information Specification ([ETSI TS 102 818 v3.4.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102800_102899/102818/03.04.01_60/ts_102818v030401p.pdf)) defines three primary documents: Service Information, Program Information, and Group Information. These documents, along with the core RadioDNS Hybrid Lookup for Radio Services Specification ([ETSI TS 103 270 v1.4.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103270/01.04.01_60/ts_103270v010401p.pdf)), define a system where an end listener device can dynamically discover program metadata and fetch the metadata via Internet Protocol (IP) requests. MetaPub's use of RadioDNS differs slightly in that MetaPub (a.k.a PRSS) acts as the \"service provider\" while the stations and related middleware act as the end devices. While this is not the primary use case of RadioDNS, the flexibility in the specification, service definitions, and DNS resolution allows this model to be easily represented. MetaPub provides both _National Metadata_ and _Station Metadata_.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that the related [RadioDNS specifications](https://radiodns.org/developers/documentation/) be read for implementation details, definitions, and required XML schemas.\n\n## ContentDepot Drive\n\nContentDepot Drive (CD Drive) provides a private, per customer file storage solution similar to other cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox. The CD Drive is used to stage content uploads such as metadata files, images, or segment audio before associating the content with specific programs or episodes.\n\nCD Drive content can be referenced using a URI by some operations such as synchronizing metadata. There are two possible CD Drive URI formats supported: ID and hierarchical path. The ID reference takes the form ```cddrive:id:{value}``` where value is the integer ID of the file or folder being referenced. The hierarchical path reference takes the form ```cddrive://{path}``` where path is the full, UNIX style path to the file or folder starting with '/'. For example, two CD Drive URIs pointing to the same file may be ```cddrive:id:12345``` and ```cddrive:///show1/episode2/metadata.xml```. More information about URIs can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe API currently uses OAuth 2.0.  All operations require ```cd:full``` access where the client access is only limited by the permissions of the ContentDepot user after authentication. Limiting access scope per client is not currently supported.\n",

    "title": "Rebilly REST API",
    "description": "# Introduction\nThe Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable\nresource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also\naccepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite\nHTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or\nyou can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)\nand [Javascript](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-js-sdk)).\n\nWe have other APIs that are also available.  Every action from our [app](https://app.rebilly.com)\nis supported by an API which is documented and available for use so that you\nmay automate any workflows necessary.  This document contains the most commonly\nintegrated resources.\n\n# Authentication\n\nWhen you sign up for an account, you are given your first secret API key.\nYou can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may\nneed to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the\nRebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.\n\nRebilly offers three forms of authentication:  secret key, publishable key, JSON Web Tokens, and public signature key.\n- [Secret API key](#section/Authentication/SecretApiKey): used for requests made\n  from the server side. Never share these keys. Keep them guarded and secure.\n- [Publishable API key](#section/Authentication/PublishableApiKey): used for \n  requests from the client side. For now can only be used to create \n  a [Payment Token](#operation/PostToken) and \n  a [File token](#operation/PostFile).\n- [JWT](#section/Authentication/JWT): short lifetime tokens that can be assigned a specific expiration time.\n\nNever share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.\n\n&lt;!-- ReDoc-Inject: &lt;security-definitions&gt; --&gt;\n\n# Errors\nRebilly follow's the error response format proposed in [RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) also known as Problem Details for HTTP APIs.  As with our normal API responses, your client must be prepared to gracefully handle additional members of the response.\n\n## Forbidden\n&lt;RedocResponse pointer={\"#/components/responses/Forbidden\"} /&gt;\n\n## Conflict\n&lt;RedocResponse pointer={\"#/components/responses/Conflict\"} /&gt;\n\n## NotFound\n&lt;RedocResponse pointer={\"#/components/responses/NotFound\"} /&gt;\n\n## Unauthorized\n&lt;RedocResponse pointer={\"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"} /&gt;\n\n## ValidationError\n&lt;RedocResponse pointer={\"#/components/responses/ValidationError\"} /&gt;\n\n# SDKs\n\nRebilly offers a Javascript SDK and a PHP SDK to help interact with\nthe API.  However, no SDK is required to use the API.\n\nRebilly also offers [FramePay](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/framepay/),\n a client-side iFrame-based solution to help\ncreate payment tokens while minimizing PCI DSS compliance burdens\nand maximizing the customizability. [FramePay](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/framepay/)\nis interacting with the [payment tokens creation operation](#operation/PostToken).\n\n## Javascript SDK\n\nInstallation and usage instructions can be found [here](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/sdks).\nSDK code examples are included in these docs.\n\n## PHP SDK\nFor all PHP SDK examples provided in these docs you will need to configure the `$client`.\nYou may do it like this:\n\n```php\n$client = new Rebilly\\Client([\n    'apiKey' =&gt; 'YourApiKeyHere',\n    'baseUrl' =&gt; 'https://api.rebilly.com',\n]);\n```\n\n# Using filter with collections\nRebilly provides collections filtering. You can use `?filter` param on collections to define which records should be shown in the response.\n\nHere is filter format description:\n\n- Fields and values in filter are separated with `:`: `?filter=firstName:John`.\n\n- Sub-fields are separated with `.`: `?filter=billingAddress.country:US`.\n\n- Multiple filters are separated with `;`: `?filter=firstName:John;lastName:Doe`. They will be joined with `AND` logic. In this example: `firstName:John` AND `lastName:Doe`.\n\n- You can use multiple values using `,` as values separator: `?filter=firstName:John,Bob`. Multiple values specified for a field will be joined with `OR` logic. In this example: `firstName:John` OR `firstName:Bob`.\n\n- To negate the filter use `!`: `?filter=firstName:!John`. Note that you can negate multiple values like this: `?filter=firstName:!John,!Bob`. This filter rule will exclude all Johns and Bobs from the response.\n\n- You can use range filters like this: `?filter=amount:1..10`.\n\n- You can use gte (greater than or equals) filter like this: `?filter=amount:1..`, or lte (less than or equals) than filter like this: `?filter=amount:..10`. This also works for datetime-based fields.\n\n- You can create some [predefined values lists](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/#tag/Lists) and use them in filter: `?filter=firstName:@yourListName`. You can also exclude list values: `?filter=firstName:!@yourListName`.\n\n- Datetime-based fields accept values formatted using RFC 3339 like this: `?filter=createdTime:2021-02-14T13:30:00Z`. \n\n# Expand to include embedded objects\nRebilly provides the ability to pre-load additional \nobjects with a request. \n\nYou can use `?expand` param on most requests to expand\nand include embedded objects within the\n`_embedded` property of the response.\n\nThe `_embedded` property contains an array of \nobjects keyed by the expand parameter value(s).\n\nYou may expand multiple objects by passing them\nas comma-separated to the expand value like so:\n\n```\n?expand=recentInvoice,customer\n```\n\nAnd in the response, you would see:\n\n```\n\"_embedded\": [\n    \"recentInvoice\": {...},\n    \"customer\": {...}\n]\n```\nExpand may be utilitized not only on `GET` requests but also on `PATCH`, `POST`, `PUT` requests too.\n\n\n# Getting started guide\n\nRebilly's API has over 300 operations.  That's more than you'll \nneed to implement your use cases.  If you have a use \ncase you would like to implement, please consult us for\nfeedback on the best API operations for the task.\n\nOur getting started guide will demonstrate a basic order form use\ncase.  It will allow us to highlight core resources\nin Rebilly that will be helpful for many other use cases\ntoo.\n\nWithin 25 minutes, you'll have sent API requests (via our console)\nto create a subscription order.\n",

    "description": "Rev.ai provides quality speech-text recognition via a RESTful API. All public methods and objects are documented here for developer reference.\nFor a real-time speech to text solution, use Rev.ai's [Streaming API](/docs/streaming).\n\n# Base Endpoint\n\nThe base url for this version of the API is\n\n> `https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1`\n\nAll endpoints described in this documentation are relative to this base url.\n\n# Quick Start\n\nFollow the [getting started checklist](https://www.rev.ai/getting_started)\n\n## Get your Access Token\n\nYou can generate your [access token](#section/Authentication/Access-Token) on the [settings page](https://www.rev.ai/access_token) of your account. This access token only needs to be generated once and never expires. You can re-generate your token, however this will invalidate the previous token.\n\n## Submit a File\n\nTo submit an audio file for transcription to Rev.ai:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1/jobs\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $REV_ACCESS_TOKEN\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"media_url\\\":\\\"https://www.rev.ai/FTC_Sample_1.mp3\\\",\\\"metadata\\\":\\\"This is a sample submit jobs option\\\"}\"\n```\n\nYou’ll receive a response like this:\n\n~~~\n{\n  \"id\": \"Umx5c6F7pH7r\",\n  \"created_on\": \"2018-09-15T05:14:38.13\",\n  \"name\": \"sample.mp3\",\n  \"metadata\": \"This is a sample submit jobs option for multipart\",\n  \"status\": \"in_progress\"\n}\n~~~\n\nThe `id` (in this case `Umx5c6F7pH7r`) will allow you to retrieve your transcript.\n\n## Get Your Transcript\n\nOnce a transcription job's `status` becomes `transcribed`, you can retrieve the transcript in JSON format by running:\n\n```\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1/jobs/{id}/transcript\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $REV_ACCESS_TOKEN\" -H \"Accept: application/vnd.rev.transcript.v1.0+json\"\n```\n\nAlternatively you can get the plain text version by running:\n\n```\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1/jobs/{id}/transcript\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $REV_ACCESS_TOKEN\" -H \"Accept: text/plain\"\n```\n\nYou can poll for the `status` of your job by querying for the job periodically:\n\n```\ncurl -X GET https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1/jobs/{id} -H \"Authorization: Bearer $REV_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n```\n\n**Note:** Polling is NOT recommended in a production server. Rather, use [webhooks](#section/Webhooks) to asynchronously receive notifications once the transcription job completes\n\nIf you have any further questions, contact us at <support@rev.ai>\n\n# Submitting Files\n\nTwo `POST` request formats can be used to submit a file: `application/json` or `multipart/form-data`.\n\n## JSON\n\nThis is the preferred method of file submission. Uses the `media_url` property to provide a direct download URL to the Rev.ai server.\nThis method supports the use of pre-signed URLs. Links to videos hosted on platforms like Youtube are not valid because they are not direct download links.\n\n**Important note on presigned URLs:**\nSigned URLs usually have an expiration time which is configurable. To ensure the Rev.ai server can access the link, make sure the expiration time is set to 2 hours or more.\nIn the event you plan on resending the same file, make sure to generate a new presigned URL.\n\n## FormData\n\nUsed to send a local file to the Rev.ai server. This allows the customer to send the file directly from the host machine.\nCertain limits apply to this format, see the [Async API Limits section](#section/Async-API-Limits) for more detals.\n\n# Turnaround Time and Chunking\n\nOften, especially for shorter files, your transcript will be ready in 5 minutes or less. It generally takes no longer than 15 minutes to return longer audios. If you require faster turn around time please contact <support@rev.ai>\n\nChunking is the act of breaking audio files into smaller segments. Rev.ai uses this method to decrease turnaround time of audios greater than 3 minutes in length.\n\n# Webhooks\n\nIf the optional `callback_url` is provided, the API will make an HTTP POST request to the `callback_url` with the\nfollowing request body when the job either completes successfully or fails.\n\n## Sample Webhook\n\n**On Successful Transcription Job**\n\n```\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"id\": \"Umx5c6F7pH7r\",\n    \"status\": \"transcribed\",\n    \"created_on\": \"2018-05-05T23:23:22.29Z\",\n    \"callback_url\": \"https://www.example.com/callback\",\n    \"duration_seconds\": 356.24,\n    \"media_url\": \"https://www.rev.ai/FTC_Sample_1.mp3\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**On Failed Transcription Job**\n\n```\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"id\": \"Umx5c6F7pH7r\",\n    \"status\": \"failed\",\n    \"created_on\": \"2018-05-05T23:23:22.29Z\",\n    \"callback_url\": \"https://www.example.com/callback\",\n    \"failure\": \"download_failure\",\n    \"failure_detail\": \"Failed to download media file. Please check your url and file type\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Important notes for using webhooks:**\nThe API will make a POST request, not a GET request, to the `callback_url`. The request body is the job details.\nYou can unsubscribe from a webhook by responding to the webhook request with a 200 response.\nIf a webhook invocation does not receive a 200 Rev.ai will retry the `callback_url` every 30 minutes until either 24 hours have passed or we receive a 200 response.\n\nFor initial webhook testing, you can try using a third party webhook testing tool such as [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/).\n\n# Async API Limits\n\nThe following default limits apply per user, per endpoint and are configurable by Rev.ai support. If you have any further questions, contact us at <support@rev.ai>\n\n- 10,000 transcription requests submitted every 10 minutes\n- 500 transcriptions processed every 10 minutes\n- Multi-part/form-data requests to the /jobs endpoint have a concurrency limit of 10 and a file size limit of 2GB\n- POST requests to the /jobs endpoint that use the media_url property do not have a concurrency limit or file restriction. They are only limited by the first two bullet points\n\n# Error Handling\n\nThe API indicates failure with 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes. 4xx status codes indicate an error due to the request provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). 5xx error indicate an error with Rev.ai's servers.\n\nWhen an 4xx error occurs during invocation of a request, the API responds with a [problem details](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) as HTTP response payload.\n\nThe problem details information is represented as a JSON object with the following optional properties:\n\n| Property   | Description                                   |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| type       | a URI representing the type for the error     |\n| title      | a short human readable description of type    |\n| details    | additional details of the error               |\n| status     | HTTP status code of the error                 |\n\nIn addition to the properties listed above, the problem details object may list additional properties that help to troubleshoot the problem.\n\n## Example Errors\n\n```\n// Bad Submit Job Request\n{\n  \"parameter\": {\n    \"media_url\": [\n      \"The media_url field is required\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"type\": \"https://www.rev.ai/api/v1/errors/invalid-parameters\",\n  \"title\": \"Your request parameters didn't validate\",\n  \"status\": 400\n}\n\n// Invalid Transcript State\n{\n  \"allowed_values\": [\n    \"transcribed\"\n  ],\n  \"current_value\": \"in_progress\",\n  \"type\": \"https://rev.ai/api/v1/errors/invalid-job-state\",\n  \"title\": \"Job is in invalid state\",\n  \"detail\": \"Job is in invalid state to obtain the transcript\",\n  \"status\": 409\n}\n```\n\n## Retrying Failed Requests\n\nSome errors can be resolved simply by retrying the request. The following error codes are likely to be resolved with successive retries.\n\n| Status Code | Error |\n|---|:---|\n| 429 | Too Many Requests |\n| 502 | Bad Gateway |\n| 503 | Service Unavailable |\n| 504 | Gateway Timeout |\n\nNote: With the exception of the 429 status code, it is recommended that the maximum number of retries be limited to 5 attempts per request. The number of retries can be higher\nfor 429 errors but if you notice consistent throttling please contact us at <support@rev.ai>.\n",

    "description": "Download OpenAPI specification: [openapi.yml](openapi.yml)\n\n# Introduction\n\nRudder exposes a REST API, enabling the user to interact with Rudder without using the webapp, for example in scripts or cronjobs.\n\n## Versioning\n\nEach time the API is extended with new features (new functions, new parameters, new responses, ...), it will be assigned a new version number. This will allow you\nto keep your existing scripts (based on previous behavior). Versions will always be integers (no 2.1 or 3.3, just 2, 3, 4, ...) or `latest`.\n\nYou can change the version of the API used by setting it either within the url or in a header:\n\n* the URL: each URL is prefixed by its version id, like `/api/version/function`.\n\n```bash\n# Version 10\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/10/rules\n# Latest\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules\n# Wrong (not an integer) => 404 not found\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/3.14/rules\n```\n\n* the HTTP headers. You can add the **X-API-Version** header to your request. The value needs to be an integer or `latest`.\n\n```bash\n# Version 10\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"X-API-Version: 10\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules\n# Wrong => Error response indicating which versions are available\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"X-API-Version: 3.14\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules\n```\n\nIn the future, we may declare some versions as deprecated, in order to remove them in a later version of Rudder, but we will never remove any versions without warning, or without a safe\nperiod of time to allow migration from previous versions.\n\n\n<h4>Existing versions</h4>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"width: 20%\">Version</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 20%\">Rudder versions it appeared in</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 70%\">Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">1</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">Never released (for internal use only)</td>\n      <td>Experimental version</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">2 to 10 (deprecated)</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">4.3 and before</td>\n      <td>These versions provided the core set of API features for rules, directives, nodes global parameters, change requests and compliance, rudder settings and system API</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">11</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">5.0</td>\n      <td>New system API (replacing old localhost v1 api): status, maintenance operations and server behavior</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">12</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">6.0 and 6.1</td>\n      <td>Node key management</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">13</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">6.2</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Node status endpoint</li>\n        <li>System health check</li>\n        <li>System maintenance job to purge software [that endpoint was back-ported in 6.1]</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">14</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">7.0</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Secret management</li>\n        <li>Directive tree</li>\n        <li>Improve techniques management</li>\n        <li>Demote a relay</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">15</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">7.1</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Package updates in nodes</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">16</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">7.2</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Create node API included from plugin</li>\n        <li>Configuration archive import/export</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n## Response format\n\nAll responses from the API are in the JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"The name of the called function\",\n  \"id\": \"The ID of the element you want, if relevant\",\n  \"result\": \"The result of your action: success or error\",\n  \"data\": \"Only present if this is a success and depends on the function, it's usually a JSON object\",\n  \"errorDetails\": \"Only present if this is an error, it contains the error message\"\n}\n```\n\n\n* __Success__ responses are sent with the 200 HTTP (Success) code\n\n* __Error__ responses are sent with a HTTP error code (mostly 5xx...)\n\n\n## HTTP method\n\nRudder's REST API is based on the usage of [HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html). We use them to indicate what action will be done by the request. Currently, we use four of them:\n\n\n* **GET**: search or retrieve information (get rule details, get a group, ...)\n\n* **PUT**: add new objects (create a directive, clone a Rule, ...)\n\n* **DELETE**: remove objects (delete a node, delete a parameter, ...)\n\n* **POST**: update existing objects (update a directive, reload a group, ...)\n\n\n## Parameters\n\n### General parameters\n\nSome parameters are available for almost all API functions. They will be described in this section.\nThey must be part of the query and can't be submitted in a JSON form.\n\n#### Available for all requests\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"width: 30%\">Field</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 10%\">Type</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 70%\">Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">prettify</td>\n      <td><b>boolean</b><br><i>optional</i></td>\n      <td>\n        Determine if the answer should be prettified (human friendly) or not.

The function will not work if this resource is missing.\n\n```bash\n# Get the Rule of ID \"id\"\ncurl -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules/id\n```\n\n\n\nCAUTION: To avoid surprising behavior, do not put a '/' at the end of an URL: it would be interpreted as '/[empty string parameter]' and redirected to '/index', likely not what you wanted to do.\n\n\n#### Sending data for POST/PUT requests\n\n##### Directly in JSON format\n\nJSON format is the preferred way to interact with Rudder API for creating or updating resources.\nYou'll also have to set the *Content-Type* header to **application/json** (without it the JSON content would be ignored).\nIn a `curl` `POST` request, that header can be provided with the `-H` parameter:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" ...\n```\n\nThe supplied file must contain a valid JSON: strings need quotes, booleans and integers don't, etc.\n\nThe (human readable) format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value1\",\n  \"key2\": false,\n  \"key3\": 42\n}\n```\n\n\nHere is an example with inlined data:\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H  \"Content-Type: application/json\"\nhttps://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}\n  -d '{ \"displayName\": \"new name\", \"enabled\": false, \"directives\": \"directiveId\"}'\n```\n\nYou can also pass a supply the JSON in a file:\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id} -d @jsonParam\n```\n\nNote that the general parameters view in the previous chapter cannot be passed in a JSON, and you will need to pass them a URL parameters if you want them to be taken into account (you can't mix JSON and request parameters):\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive with reason message \"Reason used\"\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}?reason=Reason used\" -d @jsonParam -d \"reason=Reason ignored\"\n```\n\n##### Request parameters\n\nIn some cases, when you have little, simple data to update, JSON can feel bloated. In such cases, you can use\nrequest parameters. You will need to pass one parameter for each data you want to change.\n\nParameters follow the following schema:\n\n```\nkey=value\n```\n\nYou can pass parameters by two means:\n\n* As query parameters: At the end of your url, put a **?** then your first parameter and then a **&** before next parameters. In that case, parameters need to be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[URL encoded]\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\"  https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}?\"displayName=my new name\"&\"enabled=false\"&\"directives=aDirectiveId\"\n```\n\n* As request data: You can pass those parameters in the request data, they won't figure in the URL, making it lighter to read, You can pass a file that contains data.\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive (in file directive-info.json)\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\"\nhttps://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id} -d \"displayName=my new name\" -d \"enabled=false\" -d @directive-info.json\n```\n",

    "description": "# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the documentation for the Sakari Messaging REST API. \n\nSakari provides an advanced platform to drive large scale customized SMS communication\n\nREST is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday HTTP and JSON technology.\n\nTo find out more about our product offering, please visit [https://sakari.io](https://sakari.io).\n\n# Quickstart\n\nFor your convenience we have created a quickstart guide to get you up and running in 5 minutes. \n\n[https://sakari.io/blog/sakari-api-quickstart](https://sakari.io/blog/sakari-api-quickstart)\n\n# PostMan Collection\n\nWe've created a simple set of examples using [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/) Simply click below to import these. You will need to setup three environment variables in PostMan - AccountId, ClientId and ClientSecret. Check out our PostMan blog post for more information\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/d616e273edc916a7a6eb)\n\n# Finding your client id, client secret and account id\n\nTo authenticate against the API's you will need three key pieces of data\n - client id\n - client secret\n - account id\n\nTo retrieve these, simply login into [https://hub.sakari.io](https://hub.sakari.io) and click on the \"cog\" in the top right corner. In the popup dialog at the bottom you should see your API credentials and account id. If these are not visible you will need to click on \"Request Credentials\"\n\n# Versioning\n\nWith any breaking changes we will introduce a new version of the API. The latest version is v1.\n\nThe API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break.\n\n# Testing\n\nThere are numerous tools available for testing the API's. We will include examples using curl and the client SDKs that we have created. If you would like to see an SDK in a language not currently available, please let us know.\n\n# Throttling / Limits\n\nOur API's have been specifically designed to support bulk messaging in a single API call. We therefore impose limits on the frequency of calling the APIs to prevent abuse or runaway processes. If you feel you need a higher limit, please contact us. If you hit the limit you will get a 429 error code returned from our servers\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"CONT-001\",\n    \"message\": \"Invalid mobile number\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Pagination\n\nFor performance, most GET calls return a subset of data. This data is paginated for easy access. Most APIs which return collections of data will return a pagination object as such:\n\n```\n{\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"limit\": 10\n    \"totalCount\": 21\n  }  \n}\n```\n\nWhen making calls to the API, you can adjust the slice of data returned using query parameters such as:\n\n`` https://api.sakari.io/v1/accounts/123/contacts?offset=20&limit=25 ``\n\nThis will return 25 contacts with an offset of 20.\n",

    "description": "# カラーミーショップアプリストア API\n\n[アプリストア](https://app.shop-pro.jp/)にて公開するアプリに対して、一般公開している[カラーミーショップAPI](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/docs/colorme-api)に加えて、カラーミーショップアプリストアAPI（以下、アプリストアAPIといいます）を利用することが出来ます。アプリストアAPIでは以下のことが行えます。\n- 課金データ(アプリ内課金、従量課金)の作成\n- インラインスクリプトタグの取得・作成・更新・削除\n- スクリプトタグの取得・作成・更新・削除\n\n## 利用手順\n\nアプリストアAPIを利用するには、OAuth認証が必要です。OAuth認証の基本的な流れについては[カラーミーショップAPIドキュメント](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/docs/colorme-api)を参照してください。\nアプリストアAPIの利用のために、以下のscopeが追加で指定可能になります。[カラーミーショップAPIドキュメント](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/docs/colorme-api)に掲載されているscopeと合わせてご利用ください。\n\n|スコープ|機能|\n|---|---|\n|`write_application_charge`|課金データの作成|\n|`read_shop_script_tags`|ショップページのスクリプトタグを参照|\n|`write_shop_script_tags`|ショップページへスクリプトタグを追加・更新|\n|`read_inline_script_tags`|インラインスクリプトタグを参照|\n|`write_inline_script_tags`|インラインスクリプトタグを追加・更新|\n|`read_script_tags`|スクリプトタグを参照(deprecated)|\n|`write_script_tags`|スクリプトタグを追加・更新(deprecated)|\n\n(例) カラーミーショップアカウントの認証ページを表示\n```\nhttps://api.shop-pro.jp/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=read_products%20write_products%20write_application_charge\n```\n\n## 課金設定\n料金プラン（月額課金・従量課金・買い切り）による課金や、アプリ内課金をご利用いただくにはアプリごとに課金設定の登録が必要です。\nこの設定は [カラーミーショップ デベロッパー](https://developer.shop-pro.jp) から行うことができます。\n\n登録できる課金形式やその使い方の詳細については[アプリストア 開発ガイドのアプリ課金のページ](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/getting-started/appstore-billing/)をご覧ください\n\n## アプリのインストール\nショップオーナーがアプリをインストールしたとき、以下の処理をカラーミーショップが行います。\n- 選択された料金プランに基づき課金開始\n- インストールフックの呼び出し\n\n### インストールフック\nアプリのインストール時に、インストールに関する情報を `POST` メソッド、 `application/json` 形式で通知します。\n通知先のURLは[カラーミーショップ デベロッパー](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/)にログインし、各アプリストア アプリのアプリ設定から登録を行ってください。\n\n以下のパラメータが送信されます。課金請求に必要なパラメータを含みますので、必ず受け取れるようにしてください。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`account_id`|インストールしたショップオーナーのアカウントID|PA+8桁の整数|\n|`application_charge_source_id`|プラン課金ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`recurring_application_charge_id`|（買い切り以外の課金の場合）課金契約ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`application_charge_id`|（買い切りの場合）課金契約ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`trial_term`|（無料お試し期間がある場合）無料お試し期間|JSONオブジェクト|\n|`mail`|ショップオーナーへの連絡メールアドレス|文字列|\n\n`application_charge_source_id` はデベロッパーサイトで設定したプラン課金のIDです。インストールされた料金プランの判別にご利用いただけます。\n\n`recurring_application_charge_id` と `application_charge_id` はインストールごとに発行されるユニークなIDです。ショップオーナーが一度アンインストールした後に、再度同じショップオーナーがアプリのインストールを行った際には新たに別のIDが発行されます。\n\n`recurring_application_charge_id` は「買い切り」以外の課金である「無料」「月額」「月額＋従量」「月額＋初期費用」「従量のみ」のプラン課金のインストールの際に発行されます。\n\n従量による課金を伴うプラン課金の場合は、従量分の料金を請求する際に 課金契約ID(`recurring_application_charge_id`) が必要になるので、必ず記録するようにしてください。\n\n`mail` パラメータの値はショップオーナーへの連絡手段としてご利用いただけます。インストール後に認可フローが中断され、アクセストークンが得られない際のショップオーナーへの連絡手段としてご活用いただけます。このパラメータはカラーミーショップの非公開情報として登録されている値です。左記以外の用途でこの値をアプリの機能で使用しないでください。\n\n例) 買い切りの場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"F3RN9A\",\n  \"application_charge_id\": \"A3FT4N\",\n  \"mail\": \"shop@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n例) 月額課金の場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"F3RN9A\",\n  \"recurring_application_charge_id\": \"A3FT4N\",\n  \"mail\": \"shop@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n無料お試し期間を設定した課金の場合、以下の情報を `trial_term` パラメータとして送信します。\n無料お試し期間中は従量課金APIを呼び出して課金請求することはできません。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`starts_at`|無料お試し開始日時|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)|\n|`ends_at`|無料お試し終了日時|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)|\n\n例) 無料お試し期間がある月額課金の場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"F3RN9A\",\n  \"recurring_application_charge_id\": \"A3FT4N\",\n  \"mail\": \"shop@example.com\",\n  \"trial_term\" {\n    \"starts_at\": 1565017200,\n    \"ends_at\": 1567609200\n  }\n}\n```\n\n受け取りに成功した場合は、以下のパラメータを `application/json` 形式でレスポンスボディに付与し、\nステータスコード `200` レスポンスをカラーミーショップへ返却してください。\nステータスコード `200` レスポンスをカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合、もしくは以下のパラメーターが返却されなかった場合、インストールを中止し、インストールによって発生した情報は破棄されます。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`redirect_url`|インストール成功後に遷移するURL|文字列（URL）|\n\n例)\n```\n{\n  \"redirect_url\": \"https://example.com\"\n}\n```\nインストール完了後、インストールフックのレスポンスパラメータの `redirect_url` へ画面遷移しますので、APIを利用する場合は `redirect_url` より先の画面でOAuth認証の実装をお願いします。\n\n## アプリのアンインストール\nショップオーナーがアプリをアンインストールしたとき、以下の処理をカラーミーショップが行います。\n- OAuth認証のアクセストークンの無効化\n- 登録したインラインスクリプトタグ・スクリプトタグの削除\n- 月額課金形式の場合、継続課金の無効化\n\n### アンインストールフック\nアンインストール直後に `POST` メソッドで、以下の情報を `application/json` 形式で通知します。\n通知先のURLは[カラーミーショップ デベロッパー](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/)にログインし、各アプリストア アプリのアプリ設定から登録を行ってください。\n\n※ [アンインストールAPI](#operation/deleteInstallation)のご利用によるアンインストール時はアンインストールフックは通知されません。\n\n受け取りに成功した場合はステータスコード `200` のレスポンスを返却してください。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`account_id`|アンインストールしたショップオーナーのアカウントID|PA+8桁の整数|\n|`application_charge_source_id`|プラン課金ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`uninstalled_at`|アンインストール日時|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)|\n|`reason`|アンインストール理由| `by_shop_owner` (ショップオーナーによる)<br /> `by_unpaid` (未払いによる) |\n|`recurring_application_charge_id`|（買い切り以外の課金の場合）課金契約ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`usage_charge`|（従量課金の場合）従量課金アンインストール情報|JSONオブジェクト|\n\nアンインストールフックの通知が伴うアンインストールは以下の操作のいずれかによって行われます。アンインストールの理由を `reason` パラメータで確認できます。\n\n|reasonパラメータの値|アンインストール理由|\n|---|---|\n|`by_shop_owner`|ショップオーナーによるアンインストール操作|\n|`by_unpaid`|ポイント不足による利用料徴収の失敗による自動アンインストール|\n\n課金契約ID `recurring_application_charge_id` はインストールフックで通知したIDと同じIDが通知されます。\n\n料金プランが従量課金の場合、アンインストール後に従量課金データの作成を可能にするために、以下の情報を `usage_charge` パラメータとして送信します。\nアンインストール後はOAuthのアクセストークンが無効化されているため、アクセストークンを利用して従量課金APIを呼び出すことができなくなります。\nアンインストール後はアクセストークンの代わりに `api_token` をリクエストヘッダーに含め、従量課金APIを呼び出してください。\n無料お試し期間中にアプリがアンインストールされた場合は、`api_token` は発行されません。\n詳しくは、[従量課金データの作成](https://app.shop-pro.jp/open_api#operation/createUsageCharge)を参照してください。\n`api_token` を利用した従量課金APIの呼び出しは、ポイント締め日 `closing_on` までとなっておりますので、ご注意ください。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`api_token`|アンインストール後に従量課金APIを利用いただくために必要な情報|文字列|\n|`closing_on`|ポイント締め日|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)|\n\n通常、 `closing_on` は、アンインストール直前まで利用されていた契約の期間の月末となります。以下に例を示します。\n\n|アンインストール日|直前まで利用されていた契約の期間|closing_on の示す日時|\n|---|---|---|\n|2021/01/09|2021/12/10〜2021/01/09|2021/01/31|\n|2021/01/10|2021/01/10〜2021/02/09|2021/02/28|\n\n従量課金の場合のユーザーの契約期間については[こちら](https://shop-pro.jp/manual/appstore_fee)をご参照ください\n\nアンインストールフックの例を以下に示します。\n\n例) 買い切りの場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"Q21GPC\",\n  \"uninstalled_at\": 1552022739,\n  \"reason\": \"by_shop_owner\"\n}\n```\n\n例) 月額課金の場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"EW3V21\",\n  \"recurring_application_charge_id\": \"F3RN9A\",\n  \"uninstalled_at\": 1552022740,\n  \"reason\": \"by_shop_owner\"\n}\n```\n\n例) 従量課金を含む月額課金の場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"WA37CA\",\n  \"recurring_application_charge_id\": \"F3WQ1S\",\n  \"uninstalled_at\": 1552022740,\n  \"reason\": \"by_shop_owner\",\n  \"usage_charge\": {\n    \"api_token\": \"token\",\n    \"closing_on\": 1552533465\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### アンインストールフックのリトライ\nステータスコード `200` のレスポンスをカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合は、ステータスコード `200` をカラーミーショップが受け取るまで、以下の条件で再度アンインストール情報を送信します。\nなお、カラーミーショップによるアンインストール処理は、アンインストールフックの送信結果の成否によらず、アンインストールが実行されたときに完了します。\n\n- 2時間30分ごとにアンインストールフックの仕様に基づき再送します\n- 最大で合計19回再送します\n- すべての再送の試行でステータスコード `200` をカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合は、公認デベロッパー申請時に登録されたメールアドレス宛にメールを送信します\n\n## インストール・アンインストールフックの署名検証\n`X-Appstore-Signature` リクエストヘッダーに含まれる署名を検証して、リクエストがカラーミーショップから送信されたことを確認することを推奨します。\n\n検証の手順は以下のとおりです。\n\n1. カラーミーショップが発行した `webhook_secret` を秘密鍵として、HMAC-SHA256アルゴリズムを使用してリクエストボディのダイジェスト値を取得します。\n2. ダイジェスト値をBase64エンコードした値とリクエストヘッダーに付与された署名( `X-Appstore-Signature` の値）が一致することを確認します。\n\n\nサンプルコード(ruby)\n```ruby\nWEBHOOK_SECRET = 'my_webhook_secret'\n\npayload_body = request.body.read\nsignature = Base64.strict_encode64(OpenSSL::HMAC.digest('sha256', WEBHOOK_SECRET, payload_body))\nActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(signature, request.env['HTTP_X_APPSTORE_SIGNATURE'])\n```\n\n### 発信元IPアドレスについて\n\n発信元IPアドレスは固定ではありません。そのためIPアドレスが固定されていることを前提としてアプリケーションを開発しないでください。\n\nインストールフックおよびアンインストールフックのリクエストの発信元を検証する場合は上記の署名検証を行なってください。\n",

    "id": "shorten.rest",
    "title": "Shorten.REST API Documentation",
    "description": "## Introduction\n\n\nThe Shorten.rest API allows you to programmatically create short URLs (an &apos;alias&apos;) for longer URL (a &apos;destination&apos;).\n\nEach alias you create can be used to redirect the end user (person clicking on the link) to one or more destination URLs\n\nA default destination is always set and specific destinations can be set to redirect the end user to preferred destinations based on the user&apos;s geographical location (country) and device Operating System.\n\nIn order to use the Shorten.Rest URL Shortening API you can choose to bind your own branded domain, sub-domain or to use our default domain - Short.FYI \n\n ### Destination Matching \n\n When creating or editing a short URL (&apos;alias&apos;) you can choose to specify a destination for each country and OS ([Supported OSes list](#tag/OperatingSystems)) combination. \n\n When a user clicks on the short link, Shorten.rest will examine the end user's country (determined by User's IP) and OS (User agent) and match the most suitable destination for each user. \n\n (*) If no destination is set for a specific request combination Shorten.rest will use the default destination that exists within each short URL \n\n (**) BRANDED DOMAINS: If the requested alias does not exist in our database - Shorten.rest will redirect the user to the default fallback you set within your dashboard under the ‘Alias Not Found Page Url’ value for a custom domain. \n\n (***) Operating System (OS) destinations are stronger than a country destination! \n For example - if you have a custom landing page that is targeting people in the USA and a second landing page that is hyper focused for people who use iOS devices - a person clicking on your link in the USA that is on an iPhone will be redirected to the iOS landing page, while all other devices will be redirected to the USA landing page. \n\n | OS  | Country  | Destination |\n| :------------: |:---------------:| -----|\n| iOS      |  | YourDestination.com/ios |\n|       | US        |   YourDestination.com/usa | \n\n Shorten.rest will choose the YourDestination.com/ios url as the most suitable destination.\n\n ### Branded Domain Attributes \n\n When setting up your custom domain you can include optional metatags and snippets ([Supported snippets list](#tag/Snippets)). These parameters (such as retargeting, tracking and conversion pixels) are populated and fired on click - at the time of the redirect. \n\n By default the parameters you set in the domain setting will be included in all Short URLs associated with that domain. \n\n You can always override the domain defaults for each URL by passing the appropriate variables when creating or updating a short URL \n\n ### Setting a Custom string for an Alias (short.fyi/alias) \n\n While creating a short URL you can specify which domain to use. You can choose to use your own branded domain or our default domain - Short.fyi. \n\n Each Alias is unique within a domain they are related to. This means that if multiple accounts use you the same domain (for example short.fyi), if an alias is already taken you may not create a new destination for it.\n\n That said - If you would like to use a specific alias which is already taken - the only way to do so is to create it on a new domain you own and have attached to your Shorten.rest account. \n\n ### Random Aliases \n\n By default - unless you specify a vanity URI for your alias each URL that is shortened on our platform will have a random string generated by the API. This means that if the &apos;alias&apos; attribute of a /aliases POST request is not provided, or is an empty string, a random string of seven characters will be generated and returned as part of the POST response. \n\n You can also place the @**rnd** macro within the alias field when you create a new alias, for example /vanity/@rnd, which might return an alias like /vanity/ZMAefRt, or /vanity@rnd, which might produce something like /vanityMRtvxadf. Only the first @rnd in an alias attribute will be replaced. \n\n ### NOTES \n\n ( * ) All methods of the Shorten.REST API require that your API key be provided in **x-api-key** header. \n\n (**) All API parameters are case sensitive",

    "description": "The SimplyRETS API is an exciting step towards making it easier for\ndevelopers and real estate agents to build something awesome with\nreal estate data!\n\nThe documentation below makes live requests to our API using the\ntrial data. To get set up with the API using live MLS data, you\nmust have RETS credentials from your MLS, which you can then use to\ncreate an app with SimplyRETS. For more information on that\nprocess, please see our [FAQ](https://simplyrets.com/faq), [Getting\nStarted](https://simplyrets.com/blog/getting-set-up.html) page, or\n[contact us](https://simplyrets.com/\\#home-contact).\n\nBelow you'll find the API endpoints, query parameters, response bodies,\nand other information about using the SimplyRETS API. You can run\nqueries by clicking the 'Try it Out' button at the bottom of each\nsection.\n\n### Authentication\nThe SimplyRETS API uses Basic Authentication. When you create an\napp, you'll get a set of API credentials to access your\nlistings. If you're trying out the test data, you can use\n`simplyrets:simplyrets` for connecting to the API.\n\n### Media Types\nThe SimplyRETS API uses the `Accept` header to allow clients to\ncontrol media types (content versions). We maintain backwards\ncompatibility with API clients by allowing them to specify a\ncontent version. We highly recommend setting and explicity media\ntype when your application reaches production. Both the structure\nand content of our API response bodies is subject to change so we\ncan add new features while respecting the stability of applications\nwhich have already been developed.\n\nTo always use the latest SimplyRETS content version, simply use\n`application/json` in your application `Accept` header.\n\nIf you want to pin your clients media type to a specific version,\nyou can use the vendor-specific SimplyRETS media type, e.g.\n`application/vnd.simplyrets-v0.1+json\"`\n\nTo view all valid content-types for making an `OPTIONS`, make a\nrequest to the SimplyRETS api root\n\n`curl -XOPTIONS -u simplyrets:simplyrets https://api.simplyrets.com/`\n\nThe default media types used in our API responses may change in the\nfuture. If you're building an application and care about the\nstability of the API, be sure to request a specific media type in the\nAccept header as shown in the examples below.\n\nThe wordpress plugin automatically sets the `Accept` header for the\ncompatible SimplyRETS media types.\n\n### Pagination\n\nTo paginate through listings, start your query with these\nparameters: 'limit=500&lastId=0'. The 'lastId' is the important\npart, you can use any limit up to 500. When you receive the\nresponse from the API with the results, check the 'Link' header for\nthe 'next' link. That link is pre-built to access the next 'page'\nof listings. Alternatively, you can use the last listing's 'mlsId'\nfrom the previous request and use that in the next query. For\nexample:\n\nFirst query:\n\ncurl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=0'\n\nIf the 'mlsId' in the last listing of the results is '1234567', then the next query will be:\n\ncurl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=1234567'\n\n...and so one until you have reached the final page of listings.\n\nThere a few pieces of useful information about each request stored\nin the HTTP Headers:\n\n- `X-Total-Count` shows you the total amount of listings that match\n  your current query.\n- `Link` contains pre-built pagination links for accessing the next\n'page' of listings that match your query.\n\n### RETS Vendor Compliance\n\nMany RETS vendors have strict requirements for showing disclaimers\nwith specific information embedded. For example, in many areas it's\nrequired to show the timestamp of the time the listings were\nrefreshed inside a disclaimer or on a listing page.\n\nThe timestamp of the last listing refresh timestamp can be found in\none of two spots:\n\n- The `X-SimplyRETS-LastUpdate` header from `GET /properties` or `GET /properties/{mlsId}`\n\n- Calling the API root `/` or properties api endpoint `/properties`\n  with an OPTIONS request\n\n  - `OPTIONS /`\n\n    This request will show the last update timestamp for all RETS\n    vendors associated with your application. Look for the\n    `updates` list in the JSON response.\n\n  - `OPTIONS /properties`\n\n    Using this request, look for the `lastUpdate` field in the JSON\n    response.\n",

    "description": "The Snyk API is available to customers on [Business and Enterprise plans](https://snyk.io/plans) and allows you to programatically integrate with Snyk.\n\n## REST API\n\nWe are in the process of building a new, improved API (`https://api.snyk.io/rest`) built using the OpenAPI and JSON API standards. We welcome you to try it out as we shape and release endpoints until it, ultimately, becomes a full replacement for our current API.\n\nLooking for our REST API docs? Please head over to [https://apidocs.snyk.io](https://apidocs.snyk.io)\n\n## API vs CLI vs Snyk integration\n\nThe API detailed below has the ability to test a package for issues, as they are defined by Snyk. It is important to note that for many package managers, using this API will be less accurate than running the [Snyk CLI](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk) as part of your build pipe, or just using it locally on your package. The reason for this is that more than one package version fit the requirements given in manifest files. Running the CLI locally tests the actual deployed code, and has an accurate snapshot of the dependency versions in use, while the API can only infer it, with inferior accuracy. It should be noted that the Snyk CLI has the ability to output machine-readable JSON output (with the `--json` flag to `snyk test`).\n\nA third option, is to allow Snyk access to your development flow via the existing [Snyk integrations](https://snyk.io/docs/). The advantage to this approach is having Snyk monitor every new pull request, and suggest fixes by opening new pull requests. This can be achieved either by integrating Snyk directly to your source code management (SCM) tool, or via a broker to allow greater security and auditability.\n\nIf those are not viable options, this API is your best choice.\n\n## API url\n\nThe base URL for all API endpoints is https://api.snyk.io/api/v1/\n\n## Authorization\n\nTo use this API, you must get your token from Snyk. It can be seen on https://snyk.io/account/ after you register with Snyk and login.\n\nThe token should be supplied in an `Authorization` header with the token, preceded by `token`:\n\n```http\nAuthorization: token API_KEY\n```\n\nOtherwise, a 401 \"Unauthorized\" response will be returned.\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n\n        {\n            \"code\": 401,\n            \"error\": \"Not authorised\",\n            \"message\": \"Not authorised\"\n        }\n```\n\n## Overview and entities\n\nThe API is a REST API. It has the following entities:\n\n### Test result\n\nThe test result is the object returned from the API giving the results of testing a package for issues. It has the following fields:\n\n| Property        | Type    | Description                                           | Example                                                         |\n|----------------:|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ok              | boolean | Does this package have one or more issues?             | false                                                           |\n| issues          | object  | The issues found.

The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\\n\\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution. \\n\\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\\n\\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\\n\\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\\n- Apache Blog\\n\\n\\n## References\\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5645)\\n- [jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1863)\\n\" |\n isPatchable     | boolean | Is this vulnerability fixable by using a Snyk supplied patch?

The organization determines the access rights, licenses policy and is the unit of billing for private projects.\n\nA Snyk organization has these fields:\n\nProperty    | Type   | Description                   | Example                                |\n-----------:| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\nname        | string | The organization display name | \"deelmaker\"                            |\nid          | string | The ID of the organization    | \"3ab0f8d3-b17d-4953-ab6d-e1cbfe1df385\" |\n\n## Errors\n\nThis is a beta release of this API. Therefore, despite our efforts, errors might occur. In the unlikely event of such an error, it will have the following structure as JSON in the body:\n\nProperty    | Type   | Description                   | Example                                |\n-----------:| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\nmessage     | string | Error message with reference  | Error calling Snyk api (reference: 39db46b1-ad57-47e6-a87d-e34f6968030b) |\nerrorRef    | V4 uuid | An error ref to contact Snyk with | 39db46b1-ad57-47e6-a87d-e34f6968030b |\n\nThe error reference will also be supplied in the `x-error-reference` header in the server reply.\n\nExample response:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nx-error-reference: a45ec9c1-065b-4f7b-baf8-dbd1552ffc9f\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 1848\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nDate: Sun, 10 Sep 2017 06:48:40 GMT\n```\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nTo ensure resilience against increasing request rates, we are starting to introduce rate-limiting.\nWe are monitoring the rate-limiting system to ensure minimal impact on users while ensuring system stability.\nCurrent limit is up to 2000 requests per minute, per user. This limit is above industry standards, and is subject to change. As such, we recommend calls to the API are throttled regardless of the current limit.\nAll requests above the limit will get a response with status code `429` - `Too many requests` until requests stop for the duration of the rate-limiting interval (currently a minute).\n\n## Consuming Webhooks\n\nWebhooks are delivered with a `Content-Type` of `application/json`, with the event payload as JSON in the request body. We also send the following headers:\n\n- `X-Snyk-Event` - the name of the event\n\n- `X-Snyk-Transport-ID` - a GUID to identify this delivery\n\n- `X-Snyk-Timestamp` - an ISO 8601 timestamp for when the event occurred, for example: `2020-09-25T15:27:53Z`\n\n- `X-Hub-Signature` - the HMAC hex digest of the request body, used to secure your webhooks and ensure the request did indeed come from Snyk\n\n- `User-Agent` - identifies the origin of the request, for example: `Snyk-Webhooks/XXX`\n\n---\n\nAfter your server is configured to receive payloads, it listens for any payload sent to the endpoint you configured. For security reasons, you should limit requests to those coming from Snyk.\n\n### Validating payloads\n\nAll transports sent to your webhooks have a `X-Hub-Signature` header, which contains the hash signature for the transport. The signature is a HMAC hexdigest of the request body, generated using sha256 and your `secret` as the HMAC key.\n\nYou could use a function in Node.JS such as the following to validate these signatures on incoming requests from Snyk:\n\n```javascript\nimport * as crypto from 'crypto';\n\nfunction verifySignature(request, secret) {\n  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);\n  const buffer = JSON.stringify(request.body);\n  hmac.update(buffer, 'utf8');\n\n  const signature = `sha256=${hmac.digest('hex')}`;\n\n  return signature === request.headers['x-hub-signature'];\n}\n```\n\n### Payload versioning\n\nPayloads may evolve over time, and so are versioned. Payload versions are supplied as a suffix to the `X-Snyk-Event` header. For example, `project_snapshot/v0` indicates that the payload is `v0` of the `project_snapshot` event.\n\nVersion numbers only increment when a breaking change is made; for example, removing a field that used to exist, or changing the name of a field. Version numbers do not increment when making an additive change, such as adding a new field that never existed before.\n\n**Note:** During the BETA phase, the structure of webhook payloads may change at any time, so we  recommend you check the payload version.\n\n### Event types\n\nWhile consuming a webhook event, `X-Snyk-Event` header must be checked, as an end-point may receive multiple event types.\n\n#### ping\n\nThe ping event happens after a new webhook is created, and can also be manually triggered using the ping webhook API. This is useful to test that your webhook receives data from Snyk correctly.\n\nThe `ping` event makes the following request:\n\n```jsx\nPOST /webhook-handler/snyk123 HTTP/1.1\nHost: my.app.com\nX-Snyk-Event: ping/v0\nX-Snyk-Transport-ID: 998fe884-18a0-45db-8ae0-e379eea3bc0a\nX-Snyk-Timestamp: 2020-09-25T15:27:53Z\nX-Hub-Signature: sha256=7d38cdd689735b008b3c702edd92eea23791c5f6\nUser-Agent: Snyk-Webhooks/044aadd\nContent-Type: application/json\n{\n  \"webhookId\": \"d3cf26b3-2d77-497b-bce2-23b33cc15362\"\n}\n```\n\n#### project_snapshot\n\nThis event is triggered every time an existing project is tested and a new snapshot is created. It is triggered on every test of a project, whether or not there are new issues. This event is not triggered when a new project is created or imported. Currently supported targets/scan types are Open Source and container.\n\n```jsx\nPOST /webhook-handler/snyk123 HTTP/1.1\nHost: my.app.com\nX-Snyk-Event: project_snapshot/v0\nX-Snyk-Transport-ID: 998fe884-18a0-45db-8ae0-e379eea3bc0a\nX-Snyk-Timestamp: 2020-09-25T15:27:53Z\nX-Hub-Signature: sha256=7d38cdd689735b008b3c702edd92eea23791c5f6\nUser-Agent: Snyk-Webhooks/044aadd\nContent-Type:

For web integration using iframes and/or JavaScript instead of an API, see [https://spinitron.github.io/v2-web-integration/](https://spinitron.github.io/v2-web-integration/).\n\n**Your API key** is found in the Spinitron web app. Log in to Spinitron and go to *Automation & API* in the *Admin* menu.\n\n**Authenticate** by presenting your API key using either HTTP Bearer Authorization\n(preferred)\n\n    curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOURAPIKEY' 'https://spinitron.com/api/spins'\n\nor in the query parameter `access-token` (less secure owing to webserver\nlog files)\n\n    curl 'https://spinitron.com/api/spins?access-token=YOURAPIKEY'\n\n**Limit** per page of results is 20 by default and miximally 200.\n\n**Try it out** below works to\ngenerate example cURL requests but not to get responses from Spinitron. We\ndo not accept queries sent from web browsers. Copy-paste the cURL commands\nand run them from your computer.\n\n**Cache** the data you get from the API if you are using it in web or mobile integration. It's not ok to query the API on *every* page request you serve. The [demo](https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/) shows how easy it can be to implement a file cache.\n\nAn extension to this API with access to all stations for partner applications is available.

    "title": "Svix API",
    "description": "Welcome to the Svix API documentation!\n\nUseful links: [Homepage](https://www.svix.com) | [Support email](mailto:support+docs@svix.com) | [Blog](https://www.svix.com/blog/) | [Slack Community](https://www.svix.com/slack/)\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis is the reference documentation and schemas for the [Svix webhook service](https://www.svix.com) API. For tutorials and other documentation please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.svix.com).\n\n## Main concepts\n\nIn Svix you have four important entities you will be interacting with:\n\n- `messages`: these are the webhooks being sent. They can have contents and a few other properties.\n- `application`: this is where `messages` are sent to. Usually you want to create one application for each user on your platform.\n- `endpoint`: endpoints are the URLs messages will be sent to. Each application can have multiple `endpoints` and each message sent to that application will be sent to all of them (unless they are not subscribed to the sent event type).\n- `event-type`: event types are identifiers denoting the type of the message being sent. Event types are primarily used to decide which events are sent to which endpoint.\n\n\n## Authentication\n\nGet your authentication token (`AUTH_TOKEN`) from the [Svix dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com) and use it as part of the `Authorization` header as such: `Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}`.\n\n<SecurityDefinitions />\n\n\n## Code samples\n\nThe code samples assume you already have the respective libraries installed and you know how to use them. For the latest information on how to do that, please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.svix.com/).\n\n\n## Idempotency\n\nSvix supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response.\n\nTo perform an idempotent request, pass the idempotency key in the `Idempotency-Key` header to the request. The idempotency key should be a unique value generated by the client. You can create the key in however way you like, though we suggest using UUID v4, or any other string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.\n\nSvix's idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key for any successful request. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result.\n\nPlease note that idempotency is only supported for `POST` requests.\n\n\n## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\n\nThis API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.\n",

The API is accessible via https://api.thetvdb.com and provides the following REST endpoints in JSON format.\n\n\nHow to use this API documentation\n----------------\n\n\nYou may browse the API routes without authentication, but if you wish to send requests to the API and see response data, then you must authenticate.\n1. Obtain a JWT token by `POST`ing  to the `/login` route in the `Authentication` section with your API key and credentials.\n1. Paste the JWT token from the response into the \"JWT Token\" field at the top of the page and click the 'Add Token' button.\n\n\nYou will now be able to use the remaining routes to send requests to the API and get a response.\n\n\nLanguage Selection\n----------------\n\n\nLanguage selection is done via the `Accept-Language` header. At the moment, you may only pass one language abbreviation in the header at a time. Valid language abbreviations can be found at the `/languages` route..\n\n\nAuthentication\n----------------\n\n\nAuthentication to use the API is similar to the How-to section above. Users must `POST` to the `/login` route with their API key and credentials in the following format in order to obtain a JWT token.\n\n`{\"apikey\":\"APIKEY\",\"username\":\"USERNAME\",\"userkey\":\"USERKEY\"}`\n\nNote that the username and key are ONLY required for the `/user` routes. The user's key is labled `Account Identifier` in the account section of the main site.\nThe token is then used in all subsequent requests by providing it in the `Authorization` header. The header will look like: `Authorization: Bearer <yourJWTtoken>`. Currently, the token expires after 24 hours. You can `GET` the `/refresh_token` route to extend that expiration date.\n\n\nVersioning\n----------------\n\n\nYou may request a different version of the API by including an `Accept` header in your request with the following format: `Accept:application/vnd.thetvdb.v$VERSION`. This documentation automatically uses the version seen at the top and bottom of the page.",

    "description": "\nThe public API open to the users. [Read the docs and learn more.](https://threatjammer.com/docs).\n\n## General information\n\n### Description\nThreat Jammer supports two end-user REST APIs: the User API and the Report API. The end-user uses the User API to interact with the different databases, heuristics, and machine learning processes. Devices use the Report API to interact with Threat Jammer. This document will explain how to use the User API and interact with the different services, create a token, interpret the quota information, and create the HTTP request to interact with the User API.\n\n### Authentication\nThe API is protected by a **Bearer authentication** schema. **Bearer authentication** (also called **token authentication**) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. It is used to authenticate the user. All the different endpoints expect a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header.\n\nExample:\n\n```\ncurl -X 'GET'\n  'https://dublin.api.threatjammer.com/test'\n  -H 'accept: application/json'\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'\n```\n\nYou can obtain a token after registering on the [ThreatJammer.com](https://threatjammer.com) website for free.\n\n\n### Region specific tokens\nAll the `Bearer` tokens contain information about the authorized region. The developers have to use a token created for the region they want to use. A token used in a different region will return a `401 Unauthorized` error.\n\n### Global errors\n\nThe API will return the following permanent errors:\n- a `401 Unauthorized` error if the token is not valid, or does not belong to the region.\n- a `401 Unauthorized` error if the token does not exist.\n- a `401 Unauthorized` error if the token is malformed.\n- a `403 Forbidden` error if the subscription level is not enough. Some endpoints are only available for paid subscription levels.\n\nAnd these temporary errors:\n- a `429 Too Many Requests` error if the quota is exceeded (see below).\n\n### Quota limits\n\n**Every request to the User API will consume one (1) quota point.**\n\nThe API has two rate limiting processes:\n- a quota limit of **5000** requests per month for the `FREE` account. The limit is reset every month.\n- a quota limit of **10** requests per minute for the `FREE` account. The limit is reset every minute and implements a sliding window mechanism.\n\n",

    "title": "Tisane API Documentation",
    "description": "Tisane is a natural language processing library, providing:\n\n*   standard NLP functionality\n*   special functions for detection of problematic or abusive content\n*   low-level NLP like morphological analysis and tokenization of no-space languages (Chinese, Japanese, Thai)\n    \n\nTisane has monolithic architecture. All the functions are exposed using the same language models and the same analysis process invoked using the [POST /parse](#561264c5-6dbe-4bde-aba3-7defe837989f) method. Other methods in the API are either wrappers based on the process, helper methods, or allow inspection of the language models.\n\nThe current section of the documentation describes the two structures used in the parsing & transformation methods.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nThis guide describes how to setup your Tisane account. The steps you need to complete are as follows:\n\n*   Step 1 – Create an Account\n*   Step 2 – Save Your API Key\n*   Step 3 – Integrate the API\n    \n\n## Step 1 – Create an Account\n\nNavigate to [Sign up to Tisane API](https://tisane.ai/signup/). The free Community Plan allows up to 50,000 requests but comes with a limitation of 10 requests per minute.\n\n## Step 2 - Save Your API Key\n\nYou will need the API key to make requests. Open your [Developer Profile](https://tisane.ai/developer/) to find your API keys.\n\n## Step 3 - Integrate with the API\n\nIn summary, the POST /parse method has 3 attributes: *content*, *language*, and *settings*. All 3 attributes are mandatory.\n\nFor example:  \n`{\"language\": \"en\", \"content\": \"hello\", \"settings\": {}}`\n\nRead on for more info on the [response](#response-reference) and the [settings](#settings-reference) specs. The method doc pages contain snippets of code for your favorite languages and platforms.\n\n# Response Reference\n\nThe response of the [POST /parse](#561264c5-6dbe-4bde-aba3-7defe837989f) method contains several sections displayed or hidden according to the [settings](#settings-reference) provided.\n\nThe common attributes are:\n\n*   `text` (string) - the original input\n*   `reduced_output` (boolean) - if the input is too big, and verbose information like the lexical chunk was requested, the verbose information will not be generated, and this flag will be set to `true` and returned as part of the response\n*   `sentiment` (floating-point number) - a number in range -1 to 1 indicating the document-level sentiment. Only shown when `document_sentiment` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`.\n*   `signal2noise` (floating-point number) - a signal to noise ranking of the text, in relation to the array of concepts specified in the `relevant` [setting](#settings-reference). Only shown when the `relevant` setting exists.\n    \n\n## Abusive or Problematic Content\n\nThe `abuse` section is an array of detected instances of content that may violate some terms of use. **NOTE**: the terms of use in online communities may vary, and so it is up to the administrators to determine whether the content is indeed abusive. For instance, it makes no sense to restrict sexual advances in a dating community, or censor profanities when it's accepted in the bulk of the community.\n\nThe section exists if instances of abuse are detected and the `abuse` [setting](#settings-reference) is either omitted or set to `true`.\n\nEvery instance contains the following attributes:\n\n*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the instance starts\n*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the content\n*   `sentence_index` (unsigned integer) - zero-based index of the sentence containing the instance\n*   `text` (string) - fragment of text containing the instance (only included if the `snippets` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`)\n*   `tags` (array of strings) - when exists, provides additional detail about the abuse. For instance, if the fragment is classified as an attempt to sell hard drugs, one of the tags will be *hard_drug*.\n*   `type` (string) - the type of the abuse\n*   `severity` (string) - how severe the abuse is. The levels of severity are `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `extreme`\n*   `explanation` (string) - when available, provides rationale for the annotation; set the `explain` setting to `true` to enable.\n    \n\nThe currently supported types are:\n\n*   `personal_attack` - an insult / attack on the addressee, e.g. an instance of cyberbullying. Please note that an attack on a post or a point, or just negative sentiment is not the same as an insult. The line may be blurred at times. See [our Knowledge Base for more information](http://tisane.ai/knowledgebase/how-do-i-detect-personal-attacks/).\n*   `bigotry` - hate speech aimed at one of the [protected classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_group). The hate speech detected is not just racial slurs, but, generally, hostile statements aimed at the group as a whole\n*   `profanity` - profane language, regardless of the intent\n*   `sexual_advances` - welcome or unwelcome attempts to gain some sort of sexual favor or gratification\n*   `criminal_activity` - attempts to sell or procure restricted items, criminal services, issuing death threats, and so on\n*   `external_contact` - attempts to establish contact or payment via external means of communication, e.g. phone, email, instant messaging (may violate the rules in certain communities, e.g. gig economy portals, e-commerce portals)\n*   `adult_only` - activities restricted for minors (e.g. consumption of alcohol)\n*   `mental_issues` - content indicative of suicidal thoughts or depression\n*   `allegation` - claimed knowledge or accusation of a misconduct (not necessarily crime)\n*   `provocation` - content likely to provoke an individual or a group\n*   `disturbing` - graphic descriptions that may disturb readers\n*   `no_meaningful_content` - unparseable gibberish without apparent meaning\n*   `data_leak` - private data like passwords, ID numbers, etc.\n*   `spam` - (RESERVED) spam content\n*   `generic` - undefined\n    \n\n## Sentiment Analysis\n\nThe `sentiment_expressions` section is an array of detected fragments indicating the attitude towards aspects or entities.\n\nThe section exists if sentiment is detected and the `sentiment` [setting](#settings-reference) is either omitted or set to `true`.\n\nEvery instance contains the following attributes:\n\n*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the instance starts\n*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the content\n*   `sentence_index` (unsigned integer) - zero-based index of the sentence containing the instance\n*   `text` (string) - fragment of text containing the instance (only included if the `snippets` setting is set to `true`)\n*   `polarity` (string) - whether the attitude is `positive`, `negative`, or `mixed`. Additionally, there is a `default` sentiment used for cases when the entire snippet has been pre-classified. For instance, if a review is split into two portions, *What did you like?* and *What did you not like?*, and the reviewer replies briefly, e.g. *The quiet. The service*, the utterance itself has no sentiment value. When the calling application is aware of the intended sentiment, the *default* sentiment simply provides the targets / aspects, which will be then added the sentiment externally.\n*   `targets` (array of strings) - when available, provides set of aspects and/or entities which are the targets of the sentiment. For instance, when the utterance is, *The breakfast was yummy but the staff is unfriendly*, the targets for the two sentiment expressions are `meal` and `staff`. Named entities may also be targets of the sentiment.\n*   `reasons` (array of strings) - when available, provides reasons for the sentiment. In the example utterance above (*The breakfast was yummy but the staff is unfriendly*), the `reasons` array for the `staff` is `[\"unfriendly\"]`, while the `reasons` array for `meal` is `[\"tasty\"]`.\n*   `explanation` (string) - when available, provides rationale for the sentiment; set the `explain` setting to `true` to enable.\n    \n\nExample:\n\n``` json\n\"sentiment_expressions\": [\n        {\n            \"sentence_index\": 0,\n             \"offset\": 0,\n             \"length\": 32,\n             \"polarity\": \"positive\",\n             \"reasons\": [\"close\"],\n             \"targets\": [\"location\"]\n         },\n         {\n            \"sentence_index\": 0,\n             \"offset\": 38,\n             \"length\": 29,\n             \"polarity\": \"negative\",\n             \"reasons\": [\"disrespectful\"],\n             \"targets\": [\"staff\"]\n         }\n     ]\n\n```\n\n## Entities\n\nThe `entities_summary` section is an array of named entity objects detected in the text.\n\nThe section exists if named entities are detected and the `entities` [setting](#settings-reference) is either omitted or set to `true`.\n\nEvery entity contains the following attributes:\n\n*   `name` (string) - the most complete name of the entity in the text of all the mentions\n*   `ref_lemma` (string) - when available, the dictionary form of the entity in the reference language (English) regardless of the input language\n*   `type` (string) - a string or an array of strings specifying the type of the entity, such as `person`, `organization`, `numeric`, `amount_of_money`, `place`. Certain entities, like countries, may have several types (because a country is both a `place` and an `organization`).\n*   `subtype` (string) - a string indicating the subtype of the entity\n*   `mentions` (array of objects) - a set of instances where the entity was mentioned in the text\n    \n\nEvery mention contains the following attributes:\n\n*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the instance starts\n*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the content\n*   `sentence_index` (unsigned integer) - zero-based index of the sentence containing the instance\n*   `text` (string) - fragment of text containing the instance (only included if the `snippets` setting is set to `true`)\n    \n\nExample:\n\n``` json\n \"entities_summary\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"person\",\n             \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n             \"ref_lemma\": \"John Smith\",\n             \"mentions\": [\n                {\n                    \"sentence_index\": 0,\n                     \"offset\": 0,\n                     \"length\": 10 }\n             ]\n         }\n    ,\n         {\n            \"type\": [ \"organization\", \"place\" ]\n        ,\n             \"name\": \"UK\",\n             \"ref_lemma\": \"U.K.\",\n             \"mentions\": [\n                {\n                    \"sentence_index\": 0,\n                     \"offset\": 40,\n                     \"length\": 2 }\n             ]\n         }\n     ]\n\n```\n\n### Entity Types and Subtypes\n\nThe currently supported entity types are:\n\n*   `person`, with optional subtypes: `fictional_character`, `important_person`, `spiritual_being`\n*   `organization` (note that a country is both an organization and a place)\n*   `place`\n*   `time_range`\n*   `date`\n*   `time`\n*   `hashtag`\n*   `email`\n*   `amount_of_money`\n*   `phone` phone number, either domestic or international, in a variety of formats\n*   `role` (a social role, e.g. position in an organization)\n*   `software`\n*   `website` (URL), with an optional subtype: `tor` for Onion links; note that web services may also have the `software` type assigned\n*   `weight`\n*   `bank_account` only IBAN format is supported; subtypes: `iban`\n*   `credit_card`, with optional subtypes: `visa`, `mastercard`, `american_express`, `diners_club`, `discovery`, `jcb`, `unionpay`\n*   `coordinates` (GPS coordinates)\n*   `credential`, with optional subtypes: `md5`, `sha-1`\n*   `crypto`, with optional subtypes: `bitcoin`, `ethereum`, `monero`, `monero_payment_id`, `litecoin`, `dash`\n*   `event`\n*   `file` only Windows pathnames are supported; subtypes: `windows`, `facebook` (for images downloaded from Facebook)\n*   `flight_code`\n*   `identifier`\n*   `ip_address`, subtypes: `v4`, `v6`\n*   `mac_address`\n*   `numeric` (an unclassified numeric entity)\n*   `username`\n    \n\n## Topics\n\nThe `topics` section is an array of topics (subjects, domains, themes in other terms) detected in the text.\n\nThe section exists if topics are detected and the `topics` [setting](#settings-reference) is either omitted or set to `true`.\n\nBy default, a topic is a string. If `topic_stats` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`, then every entry in the array contains:\n\n*   `topic` (string) - the topic itself\n*   `coverage` (floating-point number) - a number between 0 and 1, indicating the ratio between the number of sentences where the topic is detected to the total number of sentences\n    \n\n## Long-Term Memory\n\nThe `memory` section contains optional context to pass to the `settings` in subsequent messages in the same conversation thread. See [Context and Long-Term Memory](#context-and-long-term-memory) for more details.\n\n## Low-Level: Sentences, Phrases, and Words\n\nTisane allows obtaining more in-depth data, specifically:\n\n*   sentences and their corrected form, if a misspelling was detected\n*   lexical chunks and their grammatical and stylistic features\n*   parse trees and phrases\n    \n\nThe `sentence_list` section is generated if the `words` or the `parses` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`.\n\nEvery sentence structure in the list contains:\n\n*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the sentence starts\n*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the sentence\n*   `text` (string) - the sentence itself\n*   `corrected_text` (string) - if a misspelling was detected and the spellchecking is active, contains the automatically corrected text\n*   `words` (array of structures) - if `words` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`, generates extended information about every lexical chunk. (The term \"word\" is used for the sake of simplicity, however, it may not be linguistically correct to equate lexical chunks with words.)\n*   `parse_tree` (object) - if `parses` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`, generates information about the parse tree and the phrases detected in the sentence.\n*   `nbest_parses` (array of parse objects) if `parses` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true` and `deterministic` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `false`, generates information about the parse trees that were deemed close enough to the best one but not the best.\n    \n\n### Words\n\nEvery lexical chunk (\"word\") structure in the `words` array contains:\n\n*   `type` (string) - the type of the element: `punctuation` for punctuation marks, `numeral` for numerals, or `word` for everything else\n*   `text` (string) - the text\n*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the element starts\n*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the element\n*   `corrected_text` (string) - if a misspelling is detected, the corrected form\n*   `lettercase` (string) - the original letter case: `upper`, `capitalized`, or `mixed`. If lowercase or no case, the attribute is omitted.\n*   `stopword` (boolean) - determines whether the word is a [stopword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words)\n*   `grammar` (array of strings or structures) - generates the list of grammar features associated with the `word`. If the `feature_standard` setting is defined as `native`, then every feature is an object containing a numeral (`index`) and a string (`value`). Otherwise, every feature is a plain string\n    \n\n#### Advanced\n\nFor lexical words only:\n\n*   `role` (string) - semantic role, like `agent` or `patient`. Note that in passive voice, the semantic roles are reverse to the syntactic roles. E.g. in a sentence like *The car was driven by David*, *car* is the patient, and *David* is the agent.\n*   `numeric_value` (floating-point number) - the numeric value, if the chunk has a value associated with it\n*   `family` (integer number) - the ID of the family associated with the disambiguated word-sense of the lexical chunk\n*   `definition` (string) - the definition of the family, if the `fetch_definitions` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`\n*   `lexeme` (integer number) - the ID of the lexeme entry associated with the disambiguated word-sense of the lexical chunk\n*   `nondictionary_pattern` (integer number) - the ID of a non-dictionary pattern that matched, if the word was not in the language model but was classified by the nondictionary heuristics\n*   `style` (array of strings or structures) - generates the list of style features associated with the `word`. Only if the `feature_standard` setting is set to `native` or `description`\n*   `semantics` (array of strings or structures) - generates the list of semantic features associated with the `word`. Only if the `feature_standard` setting is set to `native` or `description`\n*   `segmentation` (structure) - generates info about the selected segmentation, if there are several possibilities to segment the current lexical chunk and the `deterministic` setting is set to `false`. A segmentation is simply an array of `word` structures.\n*   `other_segmentations` (array of structures) - generates info about the segmentations deemed incorrect during the disambiguation process. Every entry has the same structure as the `segmentation` structure.\n*   `nbest_senses` (array of structures) - when the `deterministic` setting is set to `false`, generates a set of hypotheses that were deemed incorrect by the disambiguation process. Every hypothesis contains the following attributes: `grammar`, `style`, and `semantics`, identical in structure to their counterparts above; and `senses`, an array of word-senses associated with every hypothesis. Every sense has a `family`, which is an ID of the associated family; and, if the `fetch_definitions` setting is set to `true`, `definition` and `ref_lemma` of that family.\n    \n\nFor punctuation marks only:\n\n*   `id` (integer number) - the ID of the punctuation mark\n*   `behavior` (string) - the behavior code of the punctuation mark. Values: `sentenceTerminator`, `genericComma`, `bracketStart`, `bracketEnd`, `scopeDelimiter`, `hyphen`, `quoteStart`, `quoteEnd`, `listComma` (for East-Asian enumeration commas like *、*)\n    \n\n### Parse Trees and Phrases\n\nEvery parse tree, or more accurately, parse forest, is a collection of phrases, hierarchically linked to each other.\n\nAt the top level of the parse, there is an array of root phrases under the `phrases` element and the numeric `id` associated with it. Every phrase may have children phrases. Every phrase has the following attributes:\n\n*   `type` (string) - a [Penn treebank phrase tag](http://nliblog.com/wiki/knowledge-base-2/nlp-1-natural-language-processing/penn-treebank/penn-treebank-phrase-level-tags/) denoting the type of the phrase, e.g. *S*, *VP*, *NP*, etc.\n*   `family` (integer number) - an ID of the phrase family\n*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - a zero-based offset where the phrase starts\n*   `length` (unsigned integer) - the span of the phrase\n*   `role` (string) - the semantic role of the phrase, if any, analogous to that of the words\n*   `text` (string) - the phrase text, where the phrase members are delimited by the vertical bar character. Children phrases are enclosed in brackets. E.g., *driven|by|David* or *(The|car)|was|(driven|by|David)*.\n    \n\nExample:\n\n``` json\n\"parse_tree\": {\n\"id\": 4,\n\"phrases\": [\n{\n        \"type\": \"S\",\n        \"family\": 1451,\n        \"offset\": 0,\n        \"length\": 27,\n        \"text\": \"(The|car)|was|(driven|by|David)\",\n        \"children\": [\n                {\n                        \"type\": \"NP\",\n                        \"family\": 1081,\n                        \"offset\": 0,\n                        \"length\": 7,\n                        \"text\": \"The|car\",\n                        \"role\": \"patient\"\n                },\n                {\n                        \"type\": \"VP\",\n                        \"family\": 1172,\n                        \"offset\": 12,\n                        \"length\": 15,\n                        \"text\": \"driven|by|David\",\n                        \"role\": \"verb\"\n                }\n        ]\n}\n\n```\n\n### Context-Aware Spelling Correction\n\nTisane supports automatic, context-aware spelling correction. Whether it's a misspelling or a purported obfuscation, Tisane attempts to deduce the intended meaning, if the language model does not recognize the word.\n\nWhen or if it's found, Tisane adds the `corrected_text` attribute to the word (if the words / lexical chunks are returned) and the sentence (if the sentence text is generated). Sentence-level `corrected_text` is displayed if `words` or `parses` are set to *true*.\n\nNote that as Tisane works with large dictionaries, you may need to exclude more esoteric terms by using the `min_generic_frequency` setting.\n\nNote that **the invocation of spell-checking does not depend on whether the sentences and the words sections are generated in the output**. The spellchecking can be disabled by setting `disable_spellcheck` to `true`. Another option is to enable the spellchecking for lowercase words only, thus excluding potential proper nouns in languages that support capitalization; to avoid spell-checking capitalized and uppercase words, set `lowercase_spellcheck_only` to `true`.\n\n# Settings Reference\n\nThe purpose of the settings structure is to:\n\n*   provide cues about the content being sent to improve the results\n*   customize the output and select sections to be shown\n*   define standards and formats in use\n*   define and calculate the signal to noise ranking\n    \n\nAll settings are optional. To leave all settings to default, simply provide an empty object (`{}`).\n\n## Content Cues and Instructions\n\n`format` (string) - the format of the content. Some policies will be applied depending on the format. Certain logic in the underlying language models may require the content to be of a certain format (e.g. logic applied on the reviews may seek for sentiment more aggressively). The default format is empty / undefined. The format values are:\n\n*   `review` - a review of a product or a service or any other review. Normally, the underlying language models will seek for sentiment expressions more aggressively in reviews.\n*   `dialogue` - a comment or a post which is a part of a dialogue. An example of a logic more specific to a dialogue is name calling. A single word like \"idiot\" would not be a personal attack in any other format, but it is certainly a personal attack when part of a dialogue.\n*   `shortpost` - a microblogging post, e.g. a tweet.\n*   `longform` - a long post or an article.\n*   `proofread` - a post which was proofread. In the proofread posts, the spellchecking is switched off.\n*   `alias` - a nickname in an online community.\n*   `search` - a search query. Search queries may not always be grammatically correct. Certain topics and items, that we may otherwise let pass, are tagged with the `search` format.\n    \n\n`disable_spellcheck` (boolean) - determines whether the automatic spellchecking is to be disabled. Default: `false`.\n\n`lowercase_spellcheck_only` (boolean) - determines whether the automatic spellchecking is only to be applied to words in lowercase. Default: `false`\n\n`min_generic_frequency` (int) - allows excluding more esoteric terms; the valid values are 0 thru 10.\n\n`subscope` (boolean) - enables sub-scope parsing, for scenarios like hashtag, URL parsing, and obfuscated content (e.g. *ihateyou*). Default: `false`.\n\n`lang_detect_segmentation_regex` (string) - allows defining custom language detection fragment boundaries. For example, if multiple languages may be used in different sentences in the same text, you may want to define the regex as: `(([\\r\\n]|[.!?][ ]))` .\n\n`domain_factors` (set of pairs made of strings and numbers) - provides a session-scope cues for the domains of discourse. This is a powerful tool that allows tailoring the result based on the use case. The format is, family ID of the domain as a key and the multiplication factor as a value (e.g. *\"12345\": 5.0*). For example, when processing text looking for criminal activity, we may want to set domains relevant to drugs, firearms, crime, higher: `\"domain_factors\": {\"31058\": 5.0, \"45220\": 5.0, \"14112\": 5.0, \"14509\": 3.0, \"28309\": 5.0, \"43220\": 5.0, \"34581\": 5.0}`. The same device can be used to eliminate noise coming from domains we know are irrelevant by setting the factor to a value lower than 1.\n\n`when` (date string, format YYYY-MM-DD) - indicates when the utterance was uttered. (TO BE IMPLEMENTED) The purpose is to prune word senses that were not available at a particular point in time. For example, the words *troll*, *mail*, and *post* had nothing to do with the Internet 300 years ago because there was no Internet, and so in a text that was written hundreds of years ago, we should ignore the word senses that emerged only recently.\n\n## Output Customization\n\n`abuse` (boolean) - output instances of abusive content (default: `true`)\n\n`sentiment` (boolean) - output sentiment-bearing snippets (default: `true`)\n\n`document_sentiment` (boolean) - output document-level sentiment (default: `false`)\n\n`entities` (boolean) - output entities (default: `true`)\n\n`topics` (boolean) - output topics (default: `true`), with two more relevant settings:\n\n*   `topic_stats` (boolean) - include coverage statistics in the topic output (default: `false`). When set, the topic is an object containing the attributes `topic` (string) and `coverage` (floating-point number). The coverage indicates a share of sentences touching the topic among all the sentences.\n*   `optimize_topics` (boolean) - if `true`, the less specific topics are removed if they are parts of the more specific topics. For example, when the topic is `cryptocurrency`, the optimization removes `finance`.\n    \n\n`words` (boolean) - output the lexical chunks / words for every sentence (default: `false`). In languages without white spaces (Chinese, Japanese, Thai), the tokens are tokenized words. In languages with compounds (e.g. German, Dutch, Norwegian), the compounds are split.\n\n`fetch_definitions` (boolean) - include definitions of the words in the output (default: `false`). Only relevant when the `words` setting is `true`\n\n`parses` (boolean) - output parse forests of phrases\n\n`deterministic` (boolean) - whether the n-best senses and n-best parses are to be output in addition to the detected sense. If `true`, only the detected sense will be output. Default: `true`\n\n`snippets` (boolean) - include the text snippets in the abuse, sentiment, and entities sections (default: `false`)\n\n`explain` (boolean) - if `true`, a reasoning for the abuse and sentiment snippets is provided when possible (see the `explanation` attribute)\n\n## Standards and Formats\n\n`feature_standard` (string) - determines the standard used to output the features (grammar, style, semantics) in the response object. The standards we support are:\n\n*   `ud`: [Universal Dependencies tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/) (default)\n*   `penn`: [Penn treebank tags](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html)\n*   `native`: Tisane native feature codes\n*   `description`: Tisane native feature descriptions\n    \n\nOnly the native Tisane standards (codes and descriptions) support style and semantic features.\n\n`topic_standard` (string) - determines the standard used to output the topics in the response object. The standards we support are:\n\n*   `iptc_code` - IPTC topic taxonomy code\n*   `iptc_description` - IPTC topic taxonomy description\n*   `iab_code` - IAB topic taxonomy code\n*   `iab_description` - IAB topic taxonomy description\n*   `native` - Tisane domain description, coming from the family description (default)\n    \n\n`sentiment_analysis_type` (string) - the type of the sentiment analysis strategy. The values are:\n\n*   `products_and_services` - most common sentiment analysis of products and services\n*   `entity` - sentiment analysis with entities as targets\n*   `creative_content_review` - reviews of creative content (RESERVED)\n*   `political_essay` - political essays (RESERVED)\n    \n\n## Context and Long-Term Memory\n\nHuman understanding of language is not a simple \"sliding window\" with scope limited to a sentence. Language is accompanied by gestures, visuals, and knowledge of the previous communication. Sometimes, code-words may be used to conceal the words' original meaning.\n\nWhen detecting abuse, a name of an ethnicity or a religious group may be not offensive, but when superimposed over a picture of an ape or a pig, it is meant of offend. When translating from a language without gender distinctions in verbs (like English) to a language with distinctions (like Russian or Hebrew), there is no way to know from an utterance alone if the speaker is female. When a scammer is collecting details piecemeal over a series of utterances, knowledge of previous utterances is needed to take action.\n\nTisane's Memory module allows pre-initializing the analysis, as well as reassigning meanings, and more. The module is made of three simple components that are flexible enough for a variety of tasks:\n\n### Reassignments\n\nReassignments define the attributes to set based on other attributes. This allows to:\n\n*   assign gender to 1st or 2nd person verbs, generating accurate translations\n*   overwrite original meaning of a group of words with all their inflected forms to analyze code-words and secret language\n*   add an additional feature or a hypernym to a family\n    \n\nand more, within a scope of a call.\n\nThe `assign` section is an array of structures defining:\n\n*   `if` - conditions to match:\n    *   `regex` - a regular expression (RE2 syntax)\n    *   `family` - a family ID\n    *   `features` - a list of feature values. A feature is a structure with an `index` and a `value`. For example: `{\"index\":1, \"value\":\"NOUN\"}`.\n    *   `hypernym` - a family ID of a hypernym\n*   `then` - attributes to assign\n    *   `family` - a family ID\n    *   `features` - a list of feature values. A feature is a structure with an `index` and a `value`. For example: `{\"index\":1, \"value\":\"NOUN\"}`.\n    *   `hypernym` - a family ID of a hypernym\n\nExamples:\n\n*   the speaker is female: \\`\"assign\":\\[{\"if\":{\"features\":\\[{\"index\":9,\"value\":\"1\"}\\]},\"then\":{\"features\":\\[{\"index\":5,\"value\":\"F\"}\\]}}\\]\n*   assume that a mention of a container refers to an illegal item: \\`\"assign\":\\[{\"if\":{\"family\":26888},\"then\":{\"hypernym\":123078}}\\]\n    \n\n### Flags\n\nAn array of flag structures that add some context. A flag is a structure with an `index` and a `value`. For example: `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"WFH\"}`.\n\nAside from the flags returned in the `memory` section of the response, these flags can be set:\n\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"PEBD\"}` (agents_of_bad_things) - the context is about a bad player or an agent responsible for bad things\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"BADANML\"}` (bad_animal) - the context is an animal that symbolizes bad qualities (e.g. pig, ape, snake, etc.)\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"BULKMSG\"}` (bulk_message) - the message was sent in bulk\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"DETHR\"}` (death_related) - the context is something related to death\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"EARNMUCH\"}` (make_money) - the context is related to making money\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"IDEP\"}` (my_departure) - the author of the text mentioned departing\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"SECO\"}` (sexually_conservative) - any attempt to exchange photos or anything that may be either sexual or non-sexual is to be deemed sexual\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"TRPA\"}` (trusted_party) - the author of the text claims to be a trusted party (e.g. a relative or a spouse)\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"WSTE\"}` (waste) - the context is about waste, organic or inorganic\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"WOPR\"}` (won_prize) - prize or money winning was mentioned or implied\n*   `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"WFH\"}` (work_from_home) - work from home was mentioned\n*   `{\"index\":5, \"value\":\"ORG\"}` (organization) - an organization was mentioned\n*   `{\"index\":5, \"value\":\"ROLE\"}` (role) - a role or a position was mentioned\n    \n\n### Antecedents\n\nThe section contains structures to be used in coreference resolution. The attributes are:\n\n*   `family` - the family ID of the antecedent\n*   `features` - the list of features. Every feature is a structure with an `index` and a `value`. For example: `{\"index\":36, \"value\":\"WFH\"}`.\n    \n\n## Signal to Noise Ranking\n\nWhen we're studying a bunch of posts commenting on an issue or an article, we may want to prioritize the ones more relevant to the topic, and containing more reason and logic than emotion. This is what the signal to noise ranking is meant to achieve.\n\nThe signal to noise ranking is made of two parts:\n\n1.  Determine the most relevant concepts. This part may be omitted, depending on the use case scenario (e.g. we want to track posts most relevant to a particular set of issues).\n2.  Rank the actual post in relevance to these concepts.\n    \n\nTo determine the most relevant concepts, we need to analyze the headline or the article itself. The headline is usually enough. We need two additional settings:\n\n*   `keyword_features` (an object of strings with string values) - determines the features to look for in a word. When such a feature is found, the family ID is added to the set of potentially relevant family IDs.\n*   `stop_hypernyms` (an array of integers) - if a potentially relevant family ID has a hypernym listed in this setting, it will not be considered. For example, we extracted a set of nouns from the headline, but we may not be interested in abstractions or feelings. E.g. from a headline like *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* we want *Las Vegas* only. Optional.\n    \n\nIf `keyword_features` is provided in the settings, the response will have a special attribute, `relevant`, containing a set of family IDs.\n\nAt the second stage, when ranking the actual posts or comments for relevance, this array is to be supplied among the settings. The ranking is boosted when the domain, the hypernyms, or the families related to those in the `relevant` array are mentioned, when negative and positive sentiment is linked to aspects, and penalized when the negativity is not linked to aspects, or abuse of any kind is found. The latter consideration may be disabled, e.g. when we are looking for specific criminal content. When the `abuse_not_noise` parameter is specified and set to `true`, the abuse is not penalized by the ranking calculations.\n\nTo sum it up, in order to calculate the signal to noise ranking:\n\n1.  Analyze the headline with `keyword_features` and, optionally, `stop_hypernyms` in the settings. Obtain the `relevant` attribute.\n2.  When analyzing the posts or the comments, specify the `relevant` attribute obtained in step 1.",

    "description": "At Trakt, we collect lots of interesting information about what tv shows and movies everyone is watching. Part of the fun with such data is making it available for anyone to mash up and use on their own site or app. The Trakt API was made just for this purpose. It is very easy to use, you basically call a URL and get some JSON back.\n\nMore complex API calls (such as adding a movie or show to your collection) involve sending us data. These are still easy to use, you simply POST some JSON data to a specific URL.\n\nMake sure to check out the [**Required Headers**](#introduction/required-headers) and [**Authentication**](#reference/authentication-oauth) sections for more info on what needs to be sent with each API call. Also check out the [**Terminology**](#introduction/terminology) section insight into the features Trakt supports.\n\n# Create an App\n\nTo use the Trakt API, you'll need to [**create a new API app**](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new).\n\n# Stay Connected\n\nAPI discussion and bugs should be posted in the [**GitHub Developer Forum**](https://github.com/trakt/api-help/issues) and *watch* the repository if you'd like to get notifications. Make sure to follow our [**API Blog**](https://apiblog.trakt.tv) and [**@traktapi on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/traktapi) too.\n\n# API URL\n\nThe API should always be accessed over SSL.\n\n```\nhttps://api.trakt.tv\n```\n\nIf you would like to use our sandbox environment to not fill production with test data, use this URL over SSL. **Note:** Staging is a completely separate environment, so you'll need to [**create a new API app on staging**](https://staging.trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new).\n\n```\nhttps://api-staging.trakt.tv\n```\n\n# Verbs\n\nThe API uses restful verbs.\n\n| Verb | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `GET` | Select one or more items. Success returns `200` status code. |\n| `POST` | Create a new item. Success returns `201` status code. |\n| `PUT` | Update an item. Success returns `200` status code. |\n| `DELETE` | Delete an item. Success returns `200` or `204` status code. |\n\n# Status Codes\n\nThe API will respond with one of the following HTTP status codes.\n\n| Code | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `200` | Success\n| `201` | Success - *new resource created (POST)*\n| `204` | Success - *no content to return (DELETE)*\n| `400` | Bad Request - *request couldn't be parsed*\n| `401` | Unauthorized - *OAuth must be provided*\n| `403` | Forbidden - *invalid API key or unapproved app*\n| `404` | Not Found - *method exists, but no record found*\n| `405` | Method Not Found - *method doesn't exist*\n| `409` | Conflict - *resource already created*\n| `412` | Precondition Failed - *use application/json content type*\n| `420` | Account Limit Exceeded - *list count, item count, etc*\n| `422` | Unprocessable Entity - *validation errors*\n| `423` | Locked User Account - *have the user contact support*\n| `426` | VIP Only - *user must upgrade to VIP*\n| `429` | Rate Limit Exceeded\n| `500` | Server Error - *please open a support ticket*\n| `502` | Service Unavailable - *server overloaded (try again in 30s)*\n| `503` | Service Unavailable - *server overloaded (try again in 30s)*\n| `504` | Service Unavailable - *server overloaded (try again in 30s)*\n| `520` | Service Unavailable - *Cloudflare error*\n| `521` | Service Unavailable - *Cloudflare error*\n| `522` | Service Unavailable - *Cloudflare error*\n\n# Required Headers\n\nYou'll need to send some headers when making API calls to identify your application, set the version and set the content type to JSON.\n\n| Header | Value |\n|---|---|\n| `Content-type` <span style=\"color:red;\">*</a> | `application/json` |\n| `trakt-api-key` <span style=\"color:red;\">*</a> | Your `client_id` listed under your Trakt applications. |\n| `trakt-api-version` <span style=\"color:red;\">*</a> | `2` | API version to use.\n\nAll `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods require a valid OAuth `access_token`. Some `GET` calls require OAuth and others will return user specific data if OAuth is sent. Methods that &#128274; **require** or have &#128275; **optional** OAuth will be indicated.\n\nYour OAuth library should take care of sending the auth headers for you, but for reference here's how the Bearer token should be sent.\n\n| Header | Value |\n|---|---|\n| `Authorization` | `Bearer [access_token]` |\n\n# Rate Limiting\n\nAll API methods are rate limited.

Methods with &#128196; **Pagination** will load 1 page of 10 items by default. Methods with &#128196; **Pagination Optional** will load all items by default. In either case, append a query string like `?page={page}&limit={limit}` to the URL to influence the results.\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Value |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `page` | integer | `1` | Number of page of results to be returned. |\n| `limit` | integer | `10` | Number of results to return per page. |\n\nAll paginated methods will return these HTTP headers.\n\n| Header | Value |\n|---|---|\n| `X-Pagination-Page` | Current page. |\n| `X-Pagination-Limit` | Items per page. |\n| `X-Pagination-Page-Count` | Total number of pages. |\n| `X-Pagination-Item-Count` | Total number of items. |\n\n# Extended Info\n\nBy default, all methods will return minimal info for movies, shows, episodes, people, and users. Minimal info is typically all you need to match locally cached items and includes the `title`, `year`, and `ids`. However, you can request different extended levels of information by adding `?extended={level}` to the URL. Send a comma separated string to get multiple types of extended info.\n\n**Note:** This returns a lot of extra data, so please only use extended parameters if you actually need them!\n\n| Level | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `full` | Complete info for an item.\n| `metadata` | **Collection only.** Additional video and audio info.\n\n# Filters\n\nSome `movies`, `shows`, `calendars`,  and `search` methods support additional filters and will be tagged with &#127898; **Filters**. Applying these filters refines the results and helps your users to more easily discover new items.\n\nAdd a query string (i.e. `?years=2016&genres=action`) with any filters you want to use. Some filters allow multiples which can be sent as comma delimited parameters. For example, `?genres=action,adventure` would match the `action` OR `adventure` genre.\n\n**Note:** Make sure to properly URL encode the parameters including spaces and special characters.\n\n#### Common Filters\n\n| Parameter | Multiples | Example | Value |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `query` | | `batman` | Search titles and descriptions. |\n| `years` | | `2016` | 4 digit year or range of years. |\n| `genres` | &#10003; | `action` | [Genre slugs.](#reference/genres) |\n| `languages` | &#10003; | `en` | [2 character language code.](#reference/languages) |\n| `countries` | &#10003; | `us` | [2 character country code.](#reference/countries) |\n| `runtimes` | | `30-90` | Range in minutes. |\n| `studios` | &#10003; | `marvel-studios` | Studio slugs. |\n\n#### Rating Filters\n\nTrakt, TMDB, and IMDB ratings apply to `movies`, `shows`, and `episodes`. Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic apply to `movies`.\n\n| Parameter | Multiples | Example | Value |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `ratings` | | `75-100` | Trakt rating range between `0` and `100`. |\n| `votes` | | `5000-10000` | Trakt vote count between `0` and `100000`. |\n| `tmdb_ratings` | | `5.5-10.0` | TMDB rating range between `0.0` and `10.0`. |\n| `tmdb_votes` | | `5000-10000` | TMDB vote count between `0` and `100000`. |\n| `imdb_ratings` | | `5.5-10.0` | IMDB rating range between `0.0` and `10.0`. |\n| `imdb_votes` | | `5000-10000` | IMDB vote count between `0` and `3000000`. |\n| `rt_meters` | | `5.5-10.0` | Rotten Tomatoes meter range between `0` and `100`. |\n| `metascores` | | `5.5-10.0` | Metacritic score range between `0` and `100`. |\n\n#### Movie Filters\n\n| Parameter | Multiples | Example | Value |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `certifications` | &#10003; | `pg-13` | US content certification. |\n\n#### Show Filters\n\n| Parameter | Multiples | Example | Value |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `certifications` | &#10003; | `tv-pg` | US content certification. |\n| `networks` | &#10003; | `HBO` | Network name. |\n| `status` | &#10003; | `ended` | Set to `returning series`, `continuing`, `in production`, `planned`, `upcoming`,  `pilot`, `canceled`, or `ended`. |\n\n# CORS\n\nWhen creating your API app, specify the JavaScript (CORS) origins you'll be using. We use these origins to return the headers needed for CORS.\n\n# Dates\n\nAll dates will be GMT and returned in the ISO 8601 format like `2014-09-01T09:10:11.000Z`. Adjust accordingly in your app for the user's local timezone.\n\n# Emojis\n\nWe use short codes for emojis like `:smiley:` and `:raised_hands:` and render them on the Trakt website using [**JoyPixels**](https://www.joypixels.com/) _(verion 6.6.0)_. Methods that support emojis are tagged with &#128513; **Emojis**. For POST methods, you can send standard unicode emojis and we'll automatically convert them to short codes. For GET methods, we'll return the short codes and it's up to your app to convert them back to unicode emojis.\n\n# Standard Media Objects\n\nAll methods will accept or return standard media objects for `movie`, `show`, `season`, `episode`, `person`, and `user` items. Here are examples for all minimal objects.\n\n#### movie\n\n```\n{\n    \"title\": \"Batman Begins\",\n    \"year\": 2005,\n    \"ids\": {\n        \"trakt\": 1,\n        \"slug\": \"batman-begins-2005\",\n        \"imdb\": \"tt0372784\",\n        \"tmdb\": 272\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### show\n\n```\n{\n    \"title\": \"Breaking Bad\",\n    \"year\": 2008,\n    \"ids\": {\n        \"trakt\": 1,\n        \"slug\": \"breaking-bad\",\n        \"tvdb\": 81189,\n        \"imdb\": \"tt0903747\",\n        \"tmdb\": 1396\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### season\n\n```\n{\n    \"number\": 0,\n    \"ids\": {\n        \"trakt\": 1,\n        \"tvdb\": 439371,\n        \"tmdb\": 3577\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### episode\n\n```\n{\n    \"season\": 1,\n    \"number\": 1,\n    \"title\": \"Pilot\",\n    \"ids\": {\n        \"trakt\": 16,\n        \"tvdb\": 349232,\n        \"imdb\": \"tt0959621\",\n        \"tmdb\": 62085\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### person\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"Bryan Cranston\",\n    \"ids\": {\n        \"trakt\": 142,\n        \"slug\": \"bryan-cranston\",\n        \"imdb\": \"nm0186505\",\n        \"tmdb\": 17419\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### user\n\n```\n{\n    \"username\": \"sean\",\n    \"private\": false,\n    \"name\": \"Sean Rudford\",\n    \"vip\": true,\n    \"vip_ep\": true,\n    \"ids\": {\n        \"slug\": \"sean\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# Images\n\nThe standard media objects for all `movie`, `show`, `season`, `episode`, and `person` items include an `ids` object. These `ids` map to other services like [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), [TVDB](https://thetvdb.com), [Fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com), and [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/).\n\nMost of these services have free APIs you can use to grab lots of great looking images. Here’s a chart to help you find the best artwork for your app. [**We also wrote an article to help with this.**](https://apiblog.trakt.tv/how-to-find-the-best-images-516045bcc3b6)\n\n| Media | Type | [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) | [TVDB](https://api.thetvdb.com/swagger) | [Fanart.tv](http://docs.fanarttv.apiary.io) | [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `shows` | `poster` | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; |\n|  | `fanart` | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `banner` |  | &#10003; | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `logo` |  |  | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `clearart` |  |  | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `thumb` |  |  | &#10003; |  |\n| `seasons` | `poster` | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `banner` |  | &#10003; | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `thumb` |  |  | &#10003; |  |\n| `episodes` | `screenshot` | &#10003; | &#10003; |  |  |\n| `movies` | `poster` | &#10003; |  | &#10003; | &#10003; |\n|  | `fanart` | &#10003; |  | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `banner` |  |  | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `logo` |  |  | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `clearart` |  |  | &#10003; |  |\n|  | `thumb` |  |  | &#10003; |  |\n| `person` | `headshot` | &#10003; |  |  |  |\n|  | `character` |  | &#10003; |  |  |\n\n# Website Media Links\n\nThere are several ways to construct direct links to media on the Trakt website. The website itself uses slugs so the URLs are more readable.\n\n| Type | URL |\n|---|---|\n| `movie` | `/movies/:slug` |\n| `show` | `/shows/:slug` |\n| `season` | `/shows/:slug/seasons/:num` |\n| `episode` | `/shows/:slug/seasons/:num/episodes/:num` |\n| `person` | `/people/:slug` |\n| `comment` | `/comments/:id` |\n| `list` | `/lists/:id` |\n\nYou can also create links using the Trakt, IMDB, TMDB, or TVDB IDs. We recommend using the Trakt ID if possible since that will always have full coverage. If you use the search url without an `id_type` it will return search results if multiple items are found.\n\n| Type | URL |\n|---|---|\n| `trakt` | `/search/trakt/:id` |\n|  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=movie` |\n|  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=show` |\n|  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=season` |\n|  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=episode` |\n|  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=person` |\n| `imdb` | `/search/imdb/:id` |\n| `tmdb` | `/search/tmdb/:id` |\n|  | `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=movie` |\n|  | `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=show` |\n|  | `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=episode` |\n|  | `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=person` |\n| `tvdb` | `/search/tvdb/:id` |\n|  | `/search/tvdb/:id?id_type=show` |\n|  | `/search/tvdb/:id?id_type=episode` |\n\n# Third Party Libraries\n\nAll of the libraries listed below are user contributed.

    "title": "Checks API",
    "description": "**NOTE:** This is a preview of the API and it is not considered stable since refinements are still being made.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the  **Truora Check** [**RESTful API**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) reference. You may also want to check out our [**Validations API docs**](https://docs.validations.truora.com/) or our [**Signals API docs**](https://docs.signals.truora.com/).\n\nTruora Check API allows performing full background checks on people, vehicles and companies. There are three main types of background checks:\n\n- **Personal background check**: Verifies national IDs in multiple databases of public and legal entities in the LATAM region. For every national ID, returns information on: personal identity, criminal records, international background check, and professional background.\n\n- **Vehicle background check**: Verifies the vehicle documents and the owner identity in multiple databases of public and legal entities in the LATAM region. For every vehicle and owner type, returns information on: personal identity, driving records, criminal records, and vehicle information.  \n\n- **Company background check**: Verifies the tax ID or a company name in multiple databases of public and legal entities in the LATAM region. For every company, returns the associated: business status, legal and criminal records, and media reports.\n\n# API Key V1 is live!\n\nAPI key version 1 is now live. Users with version 0 API keys are not immediately required to upgrade to V1 but should plan to do so at their earliest convenience. The changes for integration with API keys v1 are as follows:\n\n- The field ``user_authorized`` is now required to perform person checks. This field indicates the API user has authorization to perform the check in compliance with data protection law.\n- The field ``homonym_scores`` is no longer included in our person check response as its results are already included in the body of the check and keeping them duplicated is generating unnecessary confusion.\n\n\n# API composition\n\n## Endpoints\n\n- **Check endpoints**: Provide an easy way to create and search for a background check. They also allow inserting groups of checks into reports. Each check contains scores, datasets and databases.\n \n```plain\nhttps://api.truora.com/v1/checks\n```\n\n- **Report endpoints**: Support batch uploads and grouping multiple checks together. Excel and .csv files are supported for batch uploads.\n \n```plain\nhttps://api.truora.com/v1/reports\n```\n\n- **Configuration endpoints**: Allows personalizing data sets and scores for customized background checks.\n\n```plain\nhttps://api.truora.com/v1/config\n```\n\n- **Continuous check endpoints**: Allows creating recurring checks and get notified whenever a change in the check score occurs.\n\n```plain\nhttps://api.truora.com/v1/continuous_checks\n```\n\n- **Behavior endpoints**: Allows sharing anonymous feedback about a person behavior when interacting with the company.\n\n```plain\nhttps://api.truora.com/v1/behaviour\n```\n\n- **Hooks endpoints**: Allows sending notifications via requests to your service or another third-party service whenever certain events occur.\n\n```plain\nhttps://api.truora.com/v1/hooks\n```\n\n## Datasets\n\nCategories that group the resulting information for background checks from databases are called datasets. Datasets are divided in:\n\n- **Personal identity**: Corroborates the existence and validates personal identity documents. \n\n- **Criminal record**: Checks for crimes according to each country penal code or criminal code. Keep in mind that data aged less than 10 years is usually more consistent.\n\n- **Legal background**: Checks for lawsuits filed. Keep in mind that data aged less than 10 years is usually more consistent.\n\n- **International background**: Checks international lists for crimes related to identity theft, money laundering, terrorist financing, and high crimes.\n\n- **Professional background**: Checks professional regulatory entities for relevant information.\n\n- **Affiliations and insurances**: Checks the history and status of social security affiliations.\n\n- **Alert in media**: Checks major media agencies for relevant news related to violent actions.    \n\n- **Vehicle information**: Checks for the physical characteristics of the vehicle, technical status, insurance history, and other relevant information.\n\n- **Traffic fines**: Checks for outstanding traffic fines.\n\n- **Driving licenses**: Shows information relevant to the driver. Such as license status and driver certificates.\n\n- **Business background**: Checks for business status, legal and criminal history, and other relevant information.\n\n- **Taxes and Finances**: Checks for the information related to personal finances, liabilities, and taxes.\n\n## Requests Format\n\nThe POST requests receive a body that must be encoded in `www-x-form-urlencoded`, for instance:\n\n```plain\ntype=person&national_id=123456&country=CO\n```\n\nThe responses are always encoded in `JSON` format.\n\n## Errors\n\nWhenever there is an error, a JSON with the following format is returned:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"code\": <Truora error code>,\n    \"http_code\": <The HTTP status of the response>,\n    \"message\": <The error message>\n}\n```\n\nfor instance:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"code\": 10404,\n    \"http_code\": 404,\n    \"message\": \"The Check was not found\"\n}\n```\n\n## SDKs\n\nIf your favorite language was not on the next list, You can use our [OpenAPI 3 spec](https://docs.truora.com/openapi.json) to generate it using the [Open API Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation).\n\nTo download the SDK click on the desired programming language:\n\n- [C# .Net Core](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_csharp-netcore_latest.zip)\n\n- [Elixir](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_elixir_latest.zip)\n\n- [Go](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_go_latest.zip)\n\n- [Java](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_java_latest.zip)\n\n- [JavaScript](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_javascript_latest.zip)\n\n- [Objc](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_objc_latest.zip)\n\n- [Php](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_php_latest.zip)\n\n- [Python](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_python_latest.zip)\n\n- [Ruby](https://truora-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/checks/checks_ruby_latest.zip)\n\nYou can see the full list of supported platforms here:\n\nhttps://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators\n\n\n",

    "title": "Fitbit Plus API",
    "description": "# Overview\nThe Fitbit Plus API is a RESTful API. The requests and responses are formated according to the\n[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/) specification.\n\nIn addition to this documentation, we also provide an\n[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) \"yaml\" file describing the API:\n[Fitbit Plus API Specification](swagger.yaml).\n\n# Authentication\nAuthentication for the Fitbit Plus API is based on the\n[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). Fitbit Plus currently supports grant\ntypes of **client_credentials** and **refresh_token**.\n\nSee [POST /oauth/token](#operation/createToken) for details on the request and response formats.\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Building Integrations\nWe will provide customers with unique client credentials for each application/integration they build, allowing us\nto enforce appropriate access controls and monitor API usage.\nThe client credentials will be scoped to the organization, and allow full access to all patients and related data\nwithin that organization.\n\nThese credentials are appropriate for creating an integration that does one of the following:\n - background reporting/analysis\n - synchronizing data with another system (such as an EMR)\n\nThe API credentials and oauth flows we currently support are **not** well suited for creating a user-facing\napplication that allows a user (patient, coach, or admin) to login and have access to data which is appropriate to\nthat specific user. It is possible to build such an application, but it is not possible to use Fitbit Plus as a\nfederated identity provider. You would need to have a separate means of verifying a user's identity. We do not\ncurrently support the required password-based oauth flow to make this possible.\n\n# Paging\nThe Fitbit Plus API supports two different pagination strategies for GET collection endpoints.\n\n#### Skip-based paging\n\nSkip-based paging uses the query parameters `page[size]` and `page[number]` to specify the max number of resources returned and the page number. We default to skip-based paging if there are no page parameters. The response will include a `links` object containing links to the first, last, prev, and next pages of data.\n\nIf the contents of the collection change while you are iterating through the collection, you will see duplicate or missing documents. For example, if you are iterating through the `calender_event` resource via `GET /pub/calendar_event?sort=start_at&page[size]=50&page[number]=1`, and a new `calendar_event` is created that has a `start_at` value before the first `calendar_event`, when you fetch the next page at `GET /pub/calendar_event?sort=start_at&page[size]=50&page[number]=2`, the first entry in the second response will be a duplicate of the last entry in the first response.\n\n#### Cursor-based paging\nCursor-based paging uses the query parameters `page[limit]` and `page[after]` to specify the max number of entries returned and identify where to begin the next page. Add `page[limit]` to the parameters to use cursor-based paging. The response will include a `links` object containing a link to the next page of data, if the next page exists.\n\nCursor-based paging is not subject to duplication if new resources are added to the collection. For example, if you are iterating through the `calender_event` resource via `GET /pub/calendar_event?sort=start_at&page[limit]=50`, and a new `calendar_event` is created that has a `start_at` value before the first `calendar_event`, you will not see a duplicate entry when you fetch the next page at `GET /pub/calendar_event?sort=start_at&page[limit]=50&page[after]=<cursor>`.\n\nWe encourage the use of cursor-based paging for performance reasons.\n\nIn either form of paging, you can determine whether any resources were missed by comparing the number of fetched resources against `meta.count`. Set `page[size]` or `page[limit]` to 0 to get only the count.\n\nIt is not valid to mix the two strategies.\n",

    "title": "Benefits Intake",
    "description": "The Benefits Intake API allows authorized third-party systems used by Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), agencies, and Veterans to digitally submit VA benefits claim documents directly to the Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) claims intake process. This API handles documents related to the following benefit claim types: \n\n* Compensation\n* Pension/Survivors Benefits\n* Education\n* Fiduciary\n* Insurance\n* Veteran Readiness & Employment (VRE)\n* Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA)\n\nThis API also provides submission status updates until documents are successfully established for VBA claim processing, eliminating the need for users to switch between systems to manually check whether documents have been successfully uploaded.\n\n## Background \nThis API provides a secure, efficient, and tracked alternative to mail or fax for VA benefit claim document submissions. Documents are uploaded directly to the VBA so they can be processed as quickly as possible.\n\n## Technical overview\nThe Benefits Intake API first provides an upload location and unique submission identifier, and then accepts a payload consisting of a document in PDF format, zero or more optional attachments in PDF format, and some JSON metadata. \n\nThe metadata describes the document and attachments, and identifies the person for whom it is being submitted. This payload is encoded as binary multipart/form-data (not base64). The unique identifier supplied with the payload can subsequently be used to request the processing status of the uploaded document package.\n\nTo avoid errors and processing delays, API consumers are encouraged to validate the `zipcode`,`fileNumber`, `veteranFirstName`, `veteranLastName` and `businessLine` fields before submission according to their description in the DocumentUploadMetadata model and use the 'businessLine' attribute for the most efficient processing. Additionally, please ensure no PDF user passwords are used in submitted PDFs. \n\n### Attachment & file size limits\nThere is no limit on the number of files a payload can contain, but size limits do apply.\n\n* Uploaded documents cannot be larger than 21\" x 21\"\n* The entire payload cannot exceed 5 GB\n* No single file in a payload can exceed 100 MB\n\n### Date of receipt\nThe date that documents are successfully submitted through the Benefits Intake API is used as the official VA date of receipt. However, note that until a document status of `received`, `processing`, `success`, or `vbms` is returned, a client cannot consider the document received by VA. \n\nA status of `received` means that the document package has been transmitted, but may not be validated. Any errors with the document package, such as unreadable PDFs or a Veteran not found, will cause the status to change to `error`.\n\nIf the document status is `error`, VA has not received the submission and cannot honor the submission date as the date of receipt.\n\n### Authentication and Authorization\nAPI requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name 'apikey'. [Request an API key.](https://developer.va.gov/apply)\n\n### Testing in the sandbox environment\nIn the sandbox environment, the final status of a submission is `received` and submissions do not actually progress to the central mail repository or VBMS. \n\nProgress beyond the `received` status can be simulated for testing. We allow passing in a `Status-Override` header on the `/uploads/{id}` endpoint so that you can change the status of your submission to simulate the various scenarios. \n\nThe available statuses are `pending`, `uploaded`, `received`, `processing`, `success`, `vbms`, and `error`. The meaning of the various statuses is listed below in Models under DocumentUploadStatusAttributes.\n\n### Test data\nWe use mock test data in the sandbox environment. Data is not sent upstream and it is not necessary to align submitted test data with any other systems' data.\n\n### Validating documents\nUse the POST `/uploads/validate_document` endpoint to make sure your documents will pass system file requirements and\nvalidations before you send them through the submissions process. This step is optional but decreases the likelihood\nof individual document errors during the submission process.\n\nValidations performed:\n* Document is a valid PDF (Note: `Content-Type` header value must be \"application/pdf\")\n* Document does not have a user password (an owner password is acceptable)\n* File size does not exceed 100 MB\n* Page size does not exceed 21\" x 21\"\n\n### Upload operation\nAllows a client to upload a multi-part document package (form + attachments + metadata).\n\n1. Client Request: POST https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v1/\n    * No request body or parameters required\n\n2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the following attributes:\n    * `guid`: An identifier used for subsequent status requests\n    * `location`: A URL to which the actual document package payload can be submitted in the next step. The URL is specific to this upload request, and should not be re-used for subsequent uploads. The URL is valid for 900 seconds (15 minutes) from the time of this response. If the location is not used within 15 minutes, the GUID will expire. Once expired, status checks on the GUID will return a status of `expired`.\n        * Note: If, after you've submitted a document, the status hasn't changed to `uploaded` before 15 minutes has elapsed, we recommend retrying the upload in order to make sure the document properly reaches our servers. If the upload continues to fail, try encoding the payload as Base64 (See below).\n\n 3. Client Request: PUT to the location URL returned in Step 2.\n    * Request body should be encoded as binary multipart/form-data (base64 also available - see details below), equivalent to that generated by an HTML form submission or using \"curl -F…\". The format is described in more detail below.\n    * No `apikey` authorization header is required for this request, as authorization is embedded in the signed location URL.\n\n4. Service Response: The HTTP status indicates whether the upload was successful.\n    * Additionally, the response includes an ETag header containing an MD5 hash of the submitted payload. This can be compared to the submitted payload to ensure data integrity of the upload.\n\n### Status caching\nDue to current system limitations, data for the `/uploads/report` endpoint is cached for one hour.\n\nA request to the `/uploads/{id}` endpoint will return a real-time status for that GUID, and update its status in `/uploads/report`.\n\nThe `updated_at` field indicates the last time the status for a given GUID was updated.\n\n### Document Submission Statuses\n**Important note:** a submission has not been received by VA until it has a status of Received, Processing, Success, \nor VBMS. Detailed descriptions of what each status means are found in this table.\n\n| Status        | What it means |\n| ---           |     ---     |\n| **Pending**   | Initial status.<br /><br />Indicates no document package has been uploaded yet.<br /><br />Date of Receipt is not yet established with this status |\n| **Uploaded**  | Indicates document package has been successfully uploaded (PUT) from your system to the API server but has not yet been validated.<br /><br />Date of Receipt is not yet established with this status. Any errors with the document package, such as having an unreadable PDF, may cause an Error status. |\n| **Received**  | Indicates document package has been received upstream of the API and is awaiting Processing.<br /><br />The VA Date of Receipt is set when this status is achieved.<br /><br />This is the final status in the sandbox environment unless further progress is simulated. |\n| **Processing**| Indicates the document package is being validated, processed, and made ready to route and work. |\n| **Success**   | Indicates the document package has been successfully received within VA's mail handling system.<br /><br />Success is the final status for a small percentage of submitted packages with claim types, Veteran types, or exception processes that are not worked in VBMS. Most submissions reach a Success status within 1 business day. A small portion will take longer; however, some submissions may take up to 2 weeks to reach a Success status. |\n| **VBMS**      | Indicates this document package was successfully uploaded into a Veteran's eFolder within VBMS.<br /><br />On average, submissions reach VBMS status within 3 business days; however, processing times vary and some submissions may remain in a Success status for several weeks before reaching a VBMS status.<br /><br />Some document packages are worked in VA systems other than VBMS. For these submissions, Success is the final status. |\n| **Error**     | Indicates that there was an error. Refer to the error code and message for further information. |\n| **Expired**   | After a POST request, there is a 15-minute window during which documents must be uploaded via a PUT request.<br /><br />An Expired status means the documents were not successfully uploaded within this 15-minute window. We recommend coding to retry unsuccessful uploads within 15 minutes using the same submission in case of connection issues. |\n\n### Optional Base64 encoding\n\nBase64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into text format, so that encoded textual data can be easily transported over networks uncorrupted and without data loss. \n\nBase64 can be used to encode binary multipart/form-data it in its entirety.  Note that the whole payload must be encoded, not individual parts/attachments.\n\nAfter encoding your payload, you'll be required to preface your base64 string with `data:multipart/form-data;base64,` in order to allow our system to distinguish the file type. Your final string payload would look something like `data:multipart/form-data;base64,(encryption string)==` and close with the standard == marker.  Note that the multipart boundaries i.e. -----WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo and ending ------WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo- must also be included.\n\n### Consumer onboarding process\nWhen you're ready to move to production, [request a production API key.](https://developer.va.gov/go-live)\n",

    "description": "The Veteran Confirmation API allows you to confirm Veteran status for a given person. This can be useful for offering Veterans discounts or other benefits.\n\nThe API will only return “Confirmed” or “Not Confirmed”.\n\n## Quickstart Guide\n### 1. Get Access Credentials\nGet started by filling out the form on the [Apply for VA Lighthouse Developer Access](https://developer.va.gov/apply) page.\n\nAfter submitting a request, you will receive your credentials for using the API in the Development environment, which allows you to try it out with mock data before moving to the Production environment.\n\n### 2. Test the API\nIn the endpoint documentation below, we've provided a curl command builder for trying out the API before implementation with your app.\nUse [Test User](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts/confirmation_test_accounts.md) attributes to populate the request body.\n\n### 3. Build your app\nThe base URI for the Veteran Confirmation API in the Sandbox environment is:\n\nhttps://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/veteran_confirmation/v0\n\nIn this environment, use attributes from the list of [Test Users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts/confirmation_test_accounts.md). Only Test Users can return a `\"confirmed\"` response.\n\nCheck out some of our [sample apps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients). Please visit our VA Lighthouse [Support portal](https://developer.va.gov/support) should you need further assistance.\n\n### 4. Show us a demo and get access to the Production environment\nAfter building your app, we ask that you give us a demo before we set you up with production credentials. Please see the [Path to Production](https://developer.va.gov/go-live) page for more details.\n\n## Authorization\nThis API requires an API key in combination with identifiable information for the person being confirmed listed below. API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token provided in an HTTP header with name `apikey`. Including more information has a better chance of making a match and returning a Confirmed status.\n### Required information:\n* First Name\n* Last Name\n* Date of Birth\n* Social Security Number\n\n### Optional information:\n* Middle Name\n* Gender\n\n## Reference\n### Sandbox vs. Production Data\nAPIs accessed via the Sandbox environment are using the same underlying logic as VA’s production APIs; only the underlying data store is different.\n\n### Master Veteran Index (MVI)\nThe Master Veteran Index confirms a user's identity. In Production, several factors are considered to confirm identity. These include: a user’s first name, last name, date of birth and Social Security number. The MVI is mocked in the Sandbox environment. In this environment, the only factor used to confirm identity is the Social Security number.\n\n### Rate Limiting\nWe implemented basic rate limiting of 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this quota, your request will return a 429 status code. You may petition for increased rate limits by emailing and requests will be decided on a case by case basis.\n\n### Raw Open API Spec\nhttps://api.va.gov/services/veteran_confirmation/docs/v0/api\n",

    "description": "## Background\n\nThis RESTful API provides information about physical VA facilities. Information available includes\ngeographic location, address, phone, hours of operation, and available services.\n\nVA operates several different types of facilities, the types represented in this API include:\n- Health Facilities (vha)\n- Benefits Facilities (vba)\n- Cemeteries (nca)\n- Vet Centers (vc)\n\nTo read an FAQ on how wait times are calculated, click the \"For more information\" link on [this page](https://www.accesstocare.va.gov/PWT/SearchWaitTimes).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Base URLs\n\nThe base URLs for the VA Facilities API in the various environments are:\n- Sandbox: `https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/v0`\n- Production: `https://api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/v0`\n\n### Authorization\n\nAPI requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name `apikey`.\n\n### Response Formats\n\nClients may request several response formats by setting the `Accept` header.\n- `application/json` - The default JSON response format complies with JSON API. This media type is *not* available for bulk requests using the `/facilities/all` endpoint. It will return `406 Not Acceptable`.\n- `application/geo+json` - GeoJSON-compliant format, representing each facility as a feature with a point geometry.\n- `application/vnd.geo+json` - Deprecated. Prefer application/geo+json.\n- `text/csv` - Available for the bulk download operation only. Some structured fields are omitted from the CSV response.\n\n### Response Elements\n\nSome data elements within the response are only present for facilities of a given type:\n- The patient satisfaction scores contained in the `satisfaction` element are only applicable\n  to VA health facilities.\n- The patient wait time values contained in the `wait_times` element are only applicable to\n  VA health facilities.\n- The list of available services in the `services` element is only applicable to VA health and\n  benefits facilities.\n- The operational hours special instructions contained in the `operational_hours_special_instructions` element is only applicable to VA health and Vet Center facilities.\n\n### Facility ID Formats and Constraints\n\nA facility ID has the format `prefix_stationNumber`. The prefix is one of nca, vc, vba, or vha. Cemeteries may be national (VA) or non-national; non-national cemeteries have the station number prefixed with an `s`. There are no other constraints on the format. Examples:\n- Health: `vha_402GA`\n- Benefits: `vba_539GB`\n- National cemetery: `nca_063`\n- Non-national cemetery: `nca_s1082`\n- Vet center: `vc_0872MVC`\n\n\n### Mobile Facilities\n\nThe mobile health facilities move regularly within a region. If a facility comes back from this API with `\"mobile\": \"true\"`, the latitude/longitude and address could be inaccurate. To get the exact current location, please call the number listed.\n\n## Deprecations\n\n- `active_status` field is deprecated and replaced with `operating_status`.\n- `application/vnd.geo+json` media type is deprecated and replaced by `application/geo+json`\n\n\n## Reference\n\n- [Raw VA Facilities Open API Spec](https://api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/docs/v0/api)\n- [GeoJSON Format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946)\n- [JSON API Format](https://jsonapi.org/format/)",

    "description": "Use the VA Forms API to search for VA forms, get the form's PDF link and metadata, and check for new versions.\n\nVisit our VA Lighthouse [Contact Us page](https://developer.va.gov/support) for further assistance.\n\n## Background\nThis API offers an efficient way to stay up-to-date with the latest VA forms and information. The forms information listed on VA.gov matches the information returned by this API.\n- Search by form number, keyword, or title\n- Get a link to the form in PDF format\n- Get detailed form metadata including the number of pages, related forms, benefit categories, language, and more\n- Retrieve the latest date of PDF changes and the SHA256 checksum\n- Identify when a form is deleted by the VA\n\n## Technical summary\nThe VA Forms API collects form data from the official VA Form Repository on a nightly basis.  The Index endpoint can return all available forms or, if an optional query parameter is passed, will return only forms that may relate to the query value. When a valid form name is passed to the Show endpoint, it will return a single form with additional metadata and full revision history. A JSON response is given with the PDF link (if published) and the corresponding form metadata.\n\n### Authentication and authorization\nThe form information shared by this API is publicly available.  API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name apikey. [Get a sandbox API Key](https://developer.va.gov/apply).\n\n### Testing in sandbox environment\nForm data in the sandbox environment is for testing your API only, and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. This API also has a reduced API rate limit. When you're ready to move to production, be sure to [request a production API key.](https://developer.va.gov/go-live)\n\n### SHA256 revision history\nEach form is checked nightly for recent file changes. A corresponding SHA256 checksum is calculated, which provides a record of when the PDF changed and the SHA256 hash that was calculated. This allows end users to know that they have the most recent version and can verify the integrity of a previously downloaded PDF.\n\n### Valid PDF link\nAdditionally, during the nightly refresh process, the link to the form PDF is verified and the `valid_pdf` metadata is updated accordingly. If marked `true`, the link is valid and is a current form. If marked `false`, the link is either broken or the form has been removed.\n\n### Deleted forms\nIf the `deleted_at` metadata is set, that means the VA has removed this form from the repository and it is no longer to be used.\n",

    "title": "Velo Payments APIs",
    "description": "## Terms and Definitions\n\nThroughout this document and the Velo platform the following terms are used:\n\n* **Payor.** An entity (typically a corporation) which wishes to pay funds to one or more payees via a payout.\n* **Payee.** The recipient of funds paid out by a payor.\n* **Payment.** A single transfer of funds from a payor to a payee.\n* **Payout.** A batch of Payments, typically used by a payor to logically group payments (e.g. by business day). Technically there need be no relationship between the payments in a payout - a single payout can contain payments to multiple payees and/or multiple payments to a single payee.\n* **Sandbox.** An integration environment provided by Velo Payments which offers a similar API experience to the production environment, but all funding and payment events are simulated, along with many other services such as OFAC sanctions list checking.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Velo Payments API allows a payor to perform a number of operations. The following is a list of the main capabilities in a natural order of execution:\n\n* Authenticate with the Velo platform\n* Maintain a collection of payees\n* Query the payor’s current balance of funds within the platform and perform additional funding\n* Issue payments to payees\n* Query the platform for a history of those payments\n\nThis document describes the main concepts and APIs required to get up and running with the Velo Payments platform. It is not an exhaustive API reference. For that, please see the separate Velo Payments API Reference.\n\n## API Considerations\n\nThe Velo Payments API is REST based and uses the JSON format for requests and responses.\n\nMost calls are secured using OAuth 2 security and require a valid authentication access token for successful operation. See the Authentication section for details.\n\nWhere a dynamic value is required in the examples below, the {token} format is used, suggesting that the caller needs to supply the appropriate value of the token in question (without including the { or } characters).\n\nWhere curl examples are given, the –d @filename.json approach is used, indicating that the request body should be placed into a file named filename.json in the current directory. Each of the curl examples in this document should be considered a single line on the command-line, regardless of how they appear in print.\n\n## Authenticating with the Velo Platform\n\nOnce Velo backoffice staff have added your organization as a payor within the Velo platform sandbox, they will create you a payor Id, an API key and an API secret and share these with you in a secure manner.\n\nYou will need to use these values to authenticate with the Velo platform in order to gain access to the APIs. The steps to take are explained in the following:\n\ncreate a string comprising the API key (e.g. 44a9537d-d55d-4b47-8082-14061c2bcdd8) and API secret (e.g. c396b26b-137a-44fd-87f5-34631f8fd529) with a colon between them. E.g. 44a9537d-d55d-4b47-8082-14061c2bcdd8:c396b26b-137a-44fd-87f5-34631f8fd529\n\nbase64 encode this string. E.g.: NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==\n\ncreate an HTTP **Authorization** header with the value set to e.g. Basic NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==\n\nperform the Velo authentication REST call using the HTTP header created above e.g. via curl:\n\n```\n  curl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Basic NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==\" \\\n  'https://api.sandbox.velopayments.com/v1/authenticate?grant_type=client_credentials'\n```\n\nIf successful, this call will result in a **200** HTTP status code and a response body such as:\n\n```\n  {\n    \"access_token\":\"19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f\",\n    \"token_type\":\"bearer\",\n    \"expires_in\":1799,\n    \"scope\":\"...\"\n  }\n```\n## API access following authentication\nFollowing successful authentication, the value of the access_token field in the response (indicated in green above) should then be presented with all subsequent API calls to allow the Velo platform to validate that the caller is authenticated.\n\nThis is achieved by setting the HTTP Authorization header with the value set to e.g. Bearer 19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f such as the curl example below:\n\n```\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer 19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f \"\n```\n\nIf you make other Velo API calls which require authorization but the Authorization header is missing or invalid then you will get a **401** HTTP status response.\n",

This data can either be ingested periodically and managed on your local system, or calls can be made in real time to retrieve content in response to your users' activity on your systems.\n\nThe API allows product availability schedules to be retrieved in bulk or queried in real-time, and it can perform pricing calculations according to the number and type of traveler for the wide variety of product option combinations typically available in the tours and activities sales workflow.\n\nThe API provides booking and post-booking functionality, allowing booking requests, ticket purchase, and booking status updates.\n\nVarious utility services are available to map between yours and Viator's data taxonomy.\n\n**Please note:** The API does not provide services for storing data, such as user accounts. We assume that merchant partners have their own systems for storing this data.\n\n## Who is the API for?\n\nThe Viator Partner API is designed for use by organizations and individuals partnered with Viator in one of the following capacities:\n\n### Merchant partners\n\nA merchant partner is one who operates as the merchant of record; i.e., takes full responsibility for all monetary transactions carried out by their users, as well as providing customer support with regard to providing help, processing cancellations and refunds, and liaising between suppliers and customers when the need to communicate information arises.\n\nMerchant partners are invoiced periodically by Viator for all product sales. You will need to demonstrate that you have access to the appropriate infrastructure to effectively support the requisite business operations in order to become a merchant partner.\n\n### Viator Branded Affiliates (VBAs)\n\nVBAs have full access to the areas of the API relating to content, but sales of Viator products must be carried out on the Viator site itself; therefore, access to the booking or transactional endpoints necessary to operate as the merchant of record (i.e., merchant partners) is restricted. \n\nWhen a customer wishes to book a product from a VBA partner's site, they are instead redirected to [viator.com](https://viator.com) in order to complete the purchase; whereas, merchant partners are able to process and manage bookings through the Viator API itself, allowing their customers to book products without leaving the partner's site.\n\nViator affiliates instead generate unique URLs that redirect their users to the Viator site, resulting in a cookie being set such that all transactions will accrue a commission for that partner until the cookie expires.\n\nPurchases of products originating from the VBAs site are recorded and a commission on these sales is paid periodically.\n\n- **Note**: VBA partners should refer to a different document for technical specifications relevant to their partner type. If you are a VBA partner, please navigate to: [https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/affiliate/technical/](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/affiliate/technical)\n\n### VBAs with booking capability\n\nVBAs also have the option of allowing their customers to process bookings directly from their site and via the API – similar to a merchant partner – without being redirected to viator.com to complete their transaction. This partner type sends customer details, product details and credit card payment information via the API, but Viator retains control of and responsibility for processing payments and customer support.\n\n### White label partners\n\nWhite label partners do not operate their own site infrastructure. Instead, Viator provides a white label site with full functionality that can be branded according to the partner’s wishes.\n\n## Uses of the Viator Partner API\n\nThe Viator Partner API is used to carry out the following tasks:\n\n### Product search and ingestion\n\nPartners can use the product search endpoints to retrieve lists of products from Viator’s inventory relevant to their business. The available search criteria include:\n\n- The location (destination) in which the product operates\n- Whether the product is associated with a well-known tourist attraction; e.g., Empire State Building\n- The type of product (known as its category and/or subcategory)\n- The time period during which the product operates \n- Words or phrases that occur in a product's description via a free-text search\n\nPartners who prefer to download product details periodically (instead of performing all operations in real time in response to user behavior) do so by using the product search endpoints to compile a list of products that they wish to sell on their site. They then download comprehensive product details for each via the /product endpoint.\n\n#### Product search endpoints:\n\n| Endpoint | Use |\n|-|-|\n| [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) | Allows searching for products according to: destination / location, relationship to a known tourist attraction; category and/or subcategory; date of operation |\n| [/search/products/codes](#operation/searchProductsCodes) | Retrieves product details for products that match a list of product codes (unique identifiers for the product) |\n| [/search/freetext](#operation/searchFreetext) | Retrieves product details for products that include the search terms in the product's description and details. |\n| [/available/products](#operation/availableProducts) | Retrieves products that are identified by specific product codes, operate during a specified day range and accept a certain number of adult travelers |\n\n#### Product information endpoints:\n\nAll information about a product that must be communicated to customers prior to purchase is available via [/product](#operation/product) and its auxiliary endpoints. This content is generally used to construct product display pages and for performing local searches.\n\nImportant information about a product includes:\n\n- Product and supplier names\n- Geographic location\n- Product description\n- Category and subcategory\n- Photos (from both users and the supplier)\n- User reviews and ratings\n- Product options (variants of the tour/activity, such as starting times, passenger mix options, and inclusions/add-ons, including basic pricing information for each)\n- Which age ranges can participate\n- Booking details\n- Cancellation policies\n- Basic pricing\n- Logistics\n  + Inclusions (e.g., provided meals)\n  + Exclusions (e.g., entrance fees to visited attractions)\n  + Health restrictions and accessibility\n  + Departure times\n  + Passenger pick-up\n  + Duration\n  + Tour routes\n\n### Availability\n\nThe availability of a tour is communicated via the API's availability endpoints. The availability aspects of a product include:\n\n- On which days and at which times the product is available to be booked\n- Whether the product option (variant) supports a certain combination of passengers according to age and number\n- Pricing information\n\nSome partners choose to bulk-ingest availability information for their products in order to expedite this part of the customer workflow or to facilitate a local search functionality on their website; but, because this information changes very regularly, a final real-time call is generally recommended to ensure that when the booking request is submitted by the customer it is unlikely to fail on account of a change in availability.\n\n#### Availability endpoints\n\n| Endpoint | Use |\n|-|-|\n| [/booking/availability](#operation/bookingAvailability) | Returns the product option with the lowest price that is available on each day |\n| [/booking/availability/dates](#operation/bookingAvailabilityDates) | Returns all available dates for a product (but without regard to product option) |\n| [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) | Returns all product options for a product that are available on the specified day for the specified passenger mix |\n| [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgradesPricingmatrix) | Returns a detailed matrix of product options, passenger mixes and the pricing applicable to each combination |\n| [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice) | Provides a reconfirmation of a product's availability with respect to the product option and passenger mix provided and calculates a final price; used as a final availability check immediately prior to making a booking |\n\n### Booking and cancellations\n\nMerchant partners and VBAs with booking capabilities can use the Viator Partner API to purchase the product through the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) endpoint.\n\nThe API also provides services to:\n\n- Enquire about the status of an existing booking\n- Retrieve tickets/vouchers for the product\n- Cancel a booking\n\n#### Booking endpoints\n\n| Endpoint | Use |\n|-|-|\n| [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) | Make a booking / purchase a product |\n| [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus) | Retrieve multiple detailed booking statuses based on a range of specified criteria |\n| [/booking/status/items](#operation/bookingStatusItems) | Similar to [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus), but provides slightly less detail and can be called more frequently |\n\n#### Cancellation endpoints\n\n| Endpoint | Use |\n|-|-|\n| [/bookings/{booking-reference}/cancel-quote](#operation/bookingQuote) | Returns the expected outcome of a booking cancellation request (taking into consideration the product's cancellation policy) were the cancellation request performed immediately |\n| [/bookings/{booking-reference}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking) | Cancels the booking and assigns a refund depending on the product’s cancellation policy |\n\n### Auxiliary services\n\nTaxonomical data sets are required to interact meaningfully with the Viator Partner API; for example, mappings from destination (location of operation) to their respective identification codes. This information may occasionally change or be added to. Consequently, the API includes endpoints that return the most up-to-date versions of this information.\n\n#### Taxonomy endpoints\n\n| Endpoint | Use |\n|-|-|\n| [/taxonomy/destinations](#operation/taxonomyDestinations) | Retrieves a list of destination names, types and unique identifiers to be used when interacting with the Viator Partner API |\n| [/taxonomy/categories](#operation/taxonomyCategories) | Retrieves a list of product categories for a destination that can be used as a means of filtering when searching for products using the [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) endpoint |\n| [/taxonomy/attractions](#operation/taxonomyAttractions) | Retrieves a list of tourist attractions (e.g., the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building) and their associated identification codes to be used as a means of searching for available products; for example, in the [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) service |\n| [/booking/hotels](#operation/bookingHotels) | Retrieves a list of hotels, including names and geographic locations, to be used when making booking requests |\n\n---\n\n# Authentication\n\n**Note**:\n\n- The authentication mechanism for this API has been updated recently. Now, partners can also authenticate using a [new style of API key](#section/Authentication/exp-api-key) that is included in each call as a &lt;u&gt;header parameter&lt;/u&gt;. Previously, authentication was accomplished by including an API key as a query parameter.\n\n- Partners who are currently authenticating via the [API key query parameter](#section/Authentication/Legacy-API-keys) can continue to authenticate in this way; however, access to the new booking cancellation endpoints ([/bookings/cancel-reasons](#operation/cancellationReasons), [/bookings/cancel-quote](#operation/cancelBookingQuote) and [/bookings/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking)) does require the new-style of API key. All other endpoints remain compatible with both authentication methods.\n\n- If you would like to switch to the [new style of key](#section/Authentication/exp-api-key), please speak to your business development account manager.\n\n## API key\n\nAccess to the API is managed using an **API key** that is included as a **header parameter** to every call made to all API endpoints described in this document.\n\n| Header parameter name | Example value |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n| exp-api-key | bcac8986-4c33-4fa0-ad3f-75409487026c |\n\nIf you do not know the API key for your organization, please contact your business development account manager for these details.\n\nPlease note that language localization is now controlled on a per-call basis. Previously, language localization was controlled via API-key configuration, with one language available per API key. Under the present scheme, you can access any language enabled for your organization's point of sale via a **single API key**. \n\nLanguage selection is accomplished by specifying the desired language as a header parameter (`Accept-Language`). See [Accept-Language header](#section/Appendices/Accept-Language-header) for available language codes. If you would like access to additional languages, please contact your business development account manager.\n\n## Legacy API key\n\nPreviously, authenticating to this API was accomplished by passing an API-key **as a query parameter** appended to the URI for each call; e.g.:\n\n```html\nGET https://viatorapi.sandbox.viator.com/service/taxonomy/destinations?apiKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n```\n\nThis method of authentication remains available for backwards-compatibility with existing implementations. If you would like to upgrade to the new style of API key, please contact your business development account manager. \n\n# Key concepts\n\n## Content ingestion and caching strategy\n\nMuch of the information you will need to retrieve from the Viator API – such as the taxonomy, product lists and product details – do not change frequently.\n\nTherefore, we recommend implementing a caching strategy in order to eliminate unnecessary traffic to Viator’s servers and improve the operation of your site. \n\nThis section discusses the different strategies for retrieving and caching Viator’s product catalogue.\n\nYou will need to decide on how you will retrieve and manage content from Viator’s product catalogue. The two main options are as follows:\n\n### 1. API response caching\n\n*Partners retrieve content as-needed and cache responses on a service-by-service basis*\n\nIf you do not need to store product details locally, we recommend performing caching of on a service-by-service basis; i.e., storing the entire response and applying a time-to-live (TTL) of less than 24 hours.\n\n#### Benefits of API response caching\n\n* All the benefits of caching with minimal overhead\n* Minimal risk of serving stale or invalid data cached on the partner's side\n* No need to download data about products that are not selling\n* A smaller volume of local data improves cache hit performance\n* Fewer requests made of Viator's systems\n* Avoids rate limitations\n* Closer adherence to best practices\n* Removes need to manage a complex data structure locally\n\n#### Service endpoints to cache\n\nCaching should only be applied to services that yield infrequently changing data; i.e.:\n\n* [/taxonomy/destinations](](#operation/taxonomyDestinations)\n* [/taxonomy/categories](#operation/taxonomyCategories)\n* [/taxonomy/attractions](#operation/taxonomyAttractions)\n* [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts)\n* [/search/products/codes](#operation/searchProductsCodes)\n* [/search/freetext](#operation/searchFreetext)\n* [/product](#operation/product)\n* [/product/reviews](#operation/productReviews)\n* [/product/photos](#operation/productPhotos)\n* [/available/products](#operation/availableProducts)\n\n**Note**: these services should be considered cacheable even though some are POST and none include a Cache-Control HTTP header in their response.\n\n### 2. Periodic content ingestion\n\n*Partners download either the full product catalogue or a subset of the catalogue at regular intervals based on destination, linked attraction, or product category filters.*\n\n#### Who should use periodic ingestion\nThis approach may be preferable for partners whose requirements include:\n* **System agnosticism/data centralization** – i.e., partners who are simultaneously selling products from vendors other than Viator, have existing product databases or are likely to want to maintain a central product catalogue with a unified taxonomy / data structure\n* **Enhanced search capability** – i.e., the ability to apply different categorization rules, filters, exclusions or search optimizations to the product catalogue; e.g., grouping or filtering products according to criteria other than those supported directly by the Viator API (destination, attraction-link or category)\n\n#### Frequency of content ingestion\nWe recommend that you perform an ingestion of the product catalogue once every 24 hours.\n\n#### How to retrieve product codes\n\nMake a call to one of the product search services:\n\n* [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) – to search by `destId` (destination), `catId` (category), `subCatId` (subcategory) or `seoId` (attraction)\n* [/search/freetext](#operation/searchFreetext) – free-text search across all identifying fields \n\n#### How to retrieve all products in the catalogue\n\nTo retrieve all products from the Viator catalogue:\n\n* Retrieve all available destination identifiers (`destId`) from the [/taxonomy/destinations](#operation/taxonomyDestinations) service\n* Iterate through the complete list of `destId`s you retrieved in the previous step, and call [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) for each `destId`\n\n**Note**: As some products operate in multiple destinations, the same product code may be returned for a range of different destinations. Therefore, make sure your list of product codes only contains one copy of each code.\n\nYou may then iterate through this list of product codes to retrieve any other product details necessary in order to properly populate your local database with the information you require.\n\n#### Retrieving a subsection of the product catalogue\n\nYou may wish to retrieve only some of the products available in the Viator catalogue; for example, if your organization is only interested in selling products that operate locally.\n\nYour top level search using [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) is restricted to one of the three main categorization methods for products; i.e., destination, category/subcategory, or attraction-link; however, you may employ your own methods to filter the selection of products based on any attribute in the product data structure.\n\n#### Dealing with pagination using `totalCount` and `topX`\n\nDue to the large number of results that can be returned by the [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) service, the request might exceed the 30-second time-out limitation on both sandbox and live servers. Therefore, you will need to make multiple requests to this service including pagination information in order to retrieve all products that match your search criteria.\n\nThis is accomplished by sequentially requesting successive segments of the results using the `topX` request parameter together with the `totalCount` response field; i.e.:\n\n* For your first request, specify a `topX` of `\"1-100\"`\n  - **Note**: this range is *inclusive*; i.e., `\"topX\": 1-100\"` will yield the first 100 records \n* The first response will indicate the total number of records available through the value of the `totalCount` field in the response object; e.g.: `\"totalCount\": 13843`\n* For each subsequent request, specify the next logical 'chunk' of data via the `topX` parameter of the request; e.g.:\n  - \"topX\": \"1-100\"\n  - \"topX\": \"101-200\"\n  - ...\n  - \"topX\": \"13801-13843\"\n\n#### Rate limiting\n\nDue to the heavy load that pre-caching can place on Viator's servers and the downstream servers we connect to, we apply a rate limit of **150 requests per 10 second time window**.\n\nRequest rates exceeding this limit will result in a **HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)** status code being returned.\n\n**Note**: The rate is calculated over a rolling 10-second time window\n\n* In order to avoid running-up against rate limits:\n  - insert a delay of 2s if you receive a HTTP 429 status code\n  - do not run this as a multi-threaded process\n\n## Categorization of content\n\nThe products available in Viator’s catalogue are mainly categorized according to:\n\n1. **Destination**: every product in the Viator catalogue is categorized according to the destination/locale in which it operates. There are three kinds of destination:\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Destination type&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Meaning&lt;/th&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;“COUNTRY”&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;A country; e.g., “Australia”, “Japan”, “USA”&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;\"REGION\"&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;A geographical region or state; e.g., “South Australia”, “French Riviera”, “Punjab”&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;\"CITY\"&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;A city within a state; e.g., “Townsville”, “Osaka”, “Singapore”&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;destinationName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;destId&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;destinationType&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;USA&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;77&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;COUNTRY&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;22231&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;REGION&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Madison&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;24146&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;CITY&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;France&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;51&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;COUNTRY&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Brittany&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;21942&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;REGION&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Rennes&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;21943&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;CITY&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n1. **Category and subcategory**: the products in the Viator catalogue are grouped according to the kind of activity they entail and may be subcategorized further to provide greater specificity; for example:\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Subcategories&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td rowspan=3&gt;Air, Helicopter &amp; Balloon Tours&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Air Tours&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Helicopter Tours&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Balloon Rides&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td rowspan=2&gt;Weddings &amp; Honeymoons&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Wedding Packages&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Honeymoon Packages&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n1. **Attraction link** (i.e., association to a particular \"point of interest\"); e.g.:\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Attraction&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;`seoId`&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Bellagio Fountains&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;1243&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Black Canyon&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;4437&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Epcot Centre&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;1141&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n\n## Booking concepts\n\n### Booking types - *on-request* and *freesale*\n\nBookings made with Viator can be either *freesale* (immediate confirmation) or *on-request*, which require us to confirm with our product supplier that the product has not sold out and is still available. This difference must be clearly communicated to the customer during the price check and on the *order summary* post-purchase page.\n\nFor *freesale* bookings, the voucher becomes available immediately, and the customer's credit card will be charged at the time of booking. For *on-request* bookings, confirmation will be sent to the customer within a timeframe supplied in the [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice) and [/booking](#operation/bookingBook) service responses.\n\nThe customer's credit card will be charged once their *on-request* booking is confirmed.\n\n###  bookingEngineId\n\n`bookingEngineId` is a field returned in the responses from several endpoints documented in this manual. It is a **booking type specifier** indicating whether, when the product in question is booked, the booking will be `CONFIRMED` immediately or if it will remain `PENDING` even after the booking has been made, indicating that it is an on-request product.\n\n`bookingEngineId` takes *one of* the following values:\n\n  - `\"FreesaleBE\"` – the product will be confirmed immediately and the supplier will be sent a notification.\n\n  - `\"UnconditionalBE\"` - the product will be confirmed immediately and the supplier will not be notified.\n\n  - `\"DeferredCRMBE\"` - the product is an on-request product and the booking will not be confirmed immediately. The booking will remain with a `PENDING` status after it is made, to be confirmed by the supplier within the time specified in the `hoursConfirmed` field available in the booking response and post-booking services.\n\n  - `\"FreesaleOnRequestBE\"` - The product is freesale up until a certain number of days before the travel date, after which it becomes on-request. It is then referred to as being within the *on-request period*. If a booking is made within the on-request period, the product can be considered to be an on-request product. Once the booking has been made, the `bookingEngineId` will change to either `\"FreesaleOnRequestBE:OnRequest\"` or `\"FreesaleOnRequestBE:Freesold\"` depending on the travel date and the on-request period.                      \n\n### Tour grades\n\nProducts can have one or more *tour grades*. Each tour grade might represent a departure time or different tour option, such as additional meals, transport and so forth. If the tour grade code is `\"DEFAULT\"`, *do not* display this to the customer, simply hide the product's tour grade information.\n\n### Language options\n\nMany tours deliver a commentary in multiple languages using multilingual tour guides or with written or prerecorded information. Where available, the customer can preselect their preferred language option.\n\n### Traveler mix (pax)\n\nSome tour grades have defined traveler mixes used to price family passes; or, they might have special mixes for limited passenger tours, such as small buggies or weddings.\n\nThese traveler mixes are provided by the [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) service. You may need to display these to your customers so that they are able to understand why they can or cannot select a particular tour grade if there is a traveler mix mismatch.\n\n### Pick-up location and hotel lists\n\nSome products have pick-up and return shuttle bus services. For these tours, you will need the customer to supply a pick-up hotel, or they must select *live locally* or *hotel not yet booked* options.\n\nViator maintains pick-up hotel lists for many popular destinations. These lists are available for customers to select their pick-up location for various tours. For destinations without hotel lists, customers can enter the name of their hotel. If a customer's hotel is not listed, they should be able to enter a hotel name; however, pick-up may not be possible for that hotel.\n\n### Lead traveler\n\nEach tour booking requires a lead traveler to be identified. To identify the lead traveler in your request, set the `leadTraveller` flag to `true` in the traveler class.\n\n### Booking questions\n\nSome products have a list of one or more [booking questions](#section/Appendices/Booking-questions) that need to be asked. Some are mandatory. The question, a description, etc are provided in the product details object. The answers need to be included with the booking request.\n\n### SSL/HTTPS\n\nCalls to the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service *must* use a secure channel (https) as they contain credit card information.\n\n### Promo codes\n\nViator can create promotional (promo) codes for discounts and other purposes. As it's unlikely for you to wish to support this feature, we recommend supplying `null` in the `promoCode` field and not including any customer-entered fields during the checkout process.\n\n### Partner data\n\nPartners can also supply additional information for their own internal purposes. These are attached to booking reports and other materials for use in allocating commissions to agents and so forth.\n\n## Availability services\n\nProduct availability information can be retrieved with the following services:\n\n- [/booking/availability](#operation/bookingAvailability): get the tourgrade with the lowest price available on a day\n- [/booking/availability/dates](#operation/bookingAvailabilityDates): get all available dates for a product excluding days it does not operate and blockouts\n- [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades): list all available tour grades for a specific day\n- [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgradesPricingmatrix): returns available days only (ie days which have at least one tour grade available), and the pricing matrix for that tour grade on that day\n\n### Example: multiple departures in a single day\n\nMultiple departures in a single day (each represented by a tour grade) and the language options (langServices).\n\nThis request is for 3 adults on a helicopter tour:\n- **Note:** No prices are returned if the tour grade is unavailable.\n\n**Request object** ([/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades)):\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"productCode\": \"2280AAHT\",\n  \"bookingDate\": \"2013-05-11\",\n  \"currencyCode\": \"EUR\",\n  \"ageBands\": [{\n    \"bandId\": 1,\n    \"count\": 3\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n**Response object** ([/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades))\n:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"data\": [{\n    \"available\": false,\n    \"ageBands\": null,\n    \"langServices\": null,\n    \"gradeCode\": \"EARLYM\",\n    \"unavailableReason\": \"BOOKING_CUTOFF_EXPIRED\",\n    \"gradeTitle\": \"Early Morning Departure\",\n    \"gradeDepartureTime\": \"\",\n    \"gradeDescription\": \"Flight departs Las Vegas between 7am &amp;

Each object in this array details the per-age-band pricing for a specific pricing unit (`pricingUnit`) associated with that product.\n\nUsing this information, you should be able to calculate the total cost of the booking – considering any booking options – with regard to the number of participants.\n\nHow to identify the fundamental unit prices for a booking, which are then summed in order to calculate a total price, is detailed below.\n\nNote that in the response object received from the service, pricing schedules are organized hierarchically as follows:\n\n```c\nbookingDate\n--tourGrade\n----ageBand\n------price\n```\n\n### Types of pricing unit\nThere are two fundamental types of pricing unit – **per-person** and **per-group**.\n\n#### Per-person pricing schedule\nIf the pricing is *per-person*, then the total price of the booking will be directly proportional to the number of participants (passengers) of each type that are booking the product; i.e., a direct multiple of the per-person price.\n\nThe only pricing unit specifier for *per-person* pricing is “per person”, given in the `pricingUnit` field; i.e.:\n\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per person\"`\n\n| Pricing unit | Example product | Meaning |\n|--------------|---------|---------|\n| `\"per person\"` | **10040WORLD** | **Per-person pricing** – the unit price refers to the price for an individual participant.&lt;br /&gt;Some products have tiered pricing arrangements; i.e., a different per-person price can apply if certain numbers and combinations of participants in a particular age band are booking the product; e.g.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;**1-2 adults**: $50 per person&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;**3-4 adults**: $45 per person&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether a range is available to be booked depends on whether the customer’s desired passenger mix satisfies the `minimumCountRequired` and `maximumCountRequired` fields in each item of the `ageBandPrices` array. |\n\n#### Per-group pricing\nIf the pricing is per-group, then the total price of the booking will depend on the number of groups and types of group that ideally accommodate the participant mix.\n\nThe following pricing schedules follow “per-group” logic:\n\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per vehicle\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per car\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per group\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per boat\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per package\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per jetski\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per vessel\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per helicopter\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per room\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per bike\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per flight\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per plane\"`\n- `\"pricingUnit\": \"per couple\"`\n\nEligibility for a certain individual pricing schedule; or, for inclusion in a particular group type, depends on the tour grade for the product, the type of participant (e.g., the age-band they fall into) and the date of the booking.\n\n#### Group pricing schedules\n\n| Pricing unit  | Example product | Meaning |\n|---------------|-----------|---------|\n| `\"per group\"` | **10847P42**  | **Per-group** pricing – the unit price is calculated according to the number of groups the specified passenger will fit into rather than the exact number of participants. `minimumCountRequired` and `maximumCountRequired` must be considered as these fields relate to the available group sizes. |\n| `\"per room\"`  | **6279P26** | **Per-room** pricing relates the room price, which depends on the number of participants making the booking. |\n| `\"per package\"` | **25941P70**  | **Per-package** pricing refers to products that are sold as part of a package; for example a family package stipulating a passenger mix of two adults and two children |\n| `\"per vehicle\"` | **6154SHOP**  | **Per-vehicle** pricing is calculated according to the number of vehicles required for the specified passenger mix rather than the exact number of participants. `minimumCountRequired` and `maximumCountRequired` must be considered as these fields relate to the occupancy limitations for each vehicle. The minimum price will depend on the rate for a single vehicle. |\n| `\"per car\"` | **10175P10**  | **Per-car** pricing – identical to \"per vehicle\", but refers specifically to vehicles that are cars. |\n| `\"per boat\"`  | **11121P40**  | **Per-boat** pricing – identical to \"per vehicle\", but refers specifically to vehicles that are boats. |\n| `\"per jetski\"`  | **28965P127** | **Per-jetski** pricing – identical to \"per vehicle\", but refers specifically to vehicles that are jet-skis. |\n| `\"per vessel\"`  | **17295P24**  | **Per-vessel** pricing – identical to \"per vehicle\", but refers specifically to maritime vessels that are not strictly boats. |\n| `\"per helicopter\"`  | **12189P23**  | **Per-helicopter** pricing – identical to \"per vehicle\", but refers specifically to vehicles that are helicopters. |\n| `\"per bike\"`  | **17448P8** | **Per-bike** pricing – identical to \"per vehicle\", but refers specifically to vehicles that are bikes. |\n| `\"per flight\"`  | **28965P134** | **Per-flight** pricing – identical to \"per vehicle\", but refers specifically to the act of being aboard a flying vehicle. |\n| `\"per plane\"` | **14876P5** | **Per-plane** pricing – identical to \"per vehicle\", but refers specifically to vehicles that are aeroplanes. |\n\n### Interpreting response objects by example\n\nIn this section, we’ll have a look at snippets from the response objects received from the [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgradesPricingmatrix) service and interpret the results.\n\n#### Per-person pricing\n##### Request object\n```javascript\n{\n  \"productCode\": \"10040WORLD\",\n  \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n  \"month\": \"06\",\n  \"year\": \"2019\"\n}\n```\n#### Response snippet\n\n**Note:** `pricingMatrix` is an array of objects that detail the available pricing schedules for the product:\n\n```javascript\n\"pricingMatrix\": [\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 1,\n    \"pricingUnit\": \"per person\",\n    \"bookingDate\": \"2019-06-01\",\n    \"ageBandPrices\": [\n      {\n        \"bandId\": 1,\n        \"prices\": [\n          {\n            \"sortOrder\": 1,\n            \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n            \"price\": 13.85,\n            \"priceFormatted\": \"$13.85\",\n            \"merchantNetPrice\": 11.05,\n            \"merchantNetPriceFormatted\": \"$11.05\",\n            \"minNoOfTravellersRequiredForPrice\": 1\n          }\n        ],\n        \"sortOrder\": 1,\n        \"minimumCountRequired\": 0,\n        \"maximumCountRequired\": 15\n      },\n      {\n        \"bandId\": 2,\n        \"prices\": [\n          {\n            \"sortOrder\": 1,\n            \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n            \"price\": 6.92,\n            \"priceFormatted\": \"$6.92\",\n            \"merchantNetPrice\": 5.53,\n            \"merchantNetPriceFormatted\": \"$5.53\",\n            \"minNoOfTravellersRequiredForPrice\": 1\n          }\n        ],\n        \"sortOrder\": 2,\n        \"minimumCountRequired\": 0,\n        \"maximumCountRequired\": 15\n      },\n      {\n        \"bandId\": 3,\n        \"prices\": [\n          {\n            \"sortOrder\": 1,\n            \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n            \"price\": 0,\n            \"priceFormatted\": \"$0.00\",\n            \"merchantNetPrice\": 0,\n            \"merchantNetPriceFormatted\": \"$0.00\",\n            \"minNoOfTravellersRequiredForPrice\": 1\n          }\n        ],\n        \"sortOrder\": 3,\n        \"minimumCountRequired\": 0,\n        \"maximumCountRequired\": 15\n      },\n      {\n        \"bandId\": 5,\n        \"prices\": [\n          {\n            \"sortOrder\": 1,\n            \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n            \"price\": 10.39,\n            \"priceFormatted\": \"$10.39\",\n            \"merchantNetPrice\": 8.3,\n            \"merchantNetPriceFormatted\": \"$8.30\",\n            \"minNoOfTravellersRequiredForPrice\": 1\n          }\n        ],\n        \"sortOrder\": 4,\n        \"minimumCountRequired\": 0,\n        \"maximumCountRequired\": 15\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIn this example, four age bands (1, 2, 3 and 5) have pricing information available. These numerically-identified age bands are the age bands allowed to book the product. Details of the age ranges that the product operator has defined are available from the **/product** service.\n\nA call to **/product** regarding `10040WORLD` yields the following information:\n\n```javascript\n\"ageBands\": [\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 1,\n    \"ageFrom\": 13,\n    \"ageTo\": 64,\n    \"adult\": true,\n    \"bandId\": 1,\n    \"pluralDescription\": \"Adults\",\n    \"treatAsAdult\": true,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"description\": \"Adult\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 2,\n    \"ageFrom\": 65,\n    \"ageTo\": 99,\n    \"adult\": false,\n    \"bandId\": 5,\n    \"pluralDescription\": \"Seniors\",\n    \"treatAsAdult\": true,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"description\": \"Senior\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 3,\n    \"ageFrom\": 4,\n    \"ageTo\": 12,\n    \"adult\": false,\n    \"bandId\": 2,\n    \"pluralDescription\": \"Children\",\n    \"treatAsAdult\": false,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"description\": \"Child\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 4,\n    \"ageFrom\": 0,\n    \"ageTo\": 3,\n    \"adult\": false,\n    \"bandId\": 3,\n    \"pluralDescription\": \"Infants\",\n    \"treatAsAdult\": false,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"description\": \"Infant\"\n  }\n```\n\nProduct operators choose the age bands available for their product from the following five categories and define the age ranges that pertain to each band; i.e.:\n\n| `bandId` | `description` |\n|:----------:|:-----------:|\n| **1** | Adult |\n| **2** | Child |\n| **3** | Infant |\n| **4** | Youth |\n| **5** | Senior |\n\nFor this product, the age bands have been defined as follows:\n\n| `bandId` | `description` | `ageFrom` | `ageTo` |\n|:--------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| **1** | Adult | 13 | 64 |\n| **5** | Senior | 65 | 99 |\n| **2** | Child | 4 | 12 |\n| **3** | Infant | 0 | 3 |\n\nTherefore, for this product, the following pricing applies:\n\n| Passenger type | Number | Price |\n|----------------|:------:|-------|\n| **Adult** | 1-15 | $13.85 per person |\n| **Senior** | 1-15 | $10.39 per person |\n| **Child** | 1-15 | $6.92 per person |\n| **Infant** | 1-15 | free ($0) |\n\nPer-person pricing might depend on the mix of passengers booking the tour.

according to the size of the group in question. In this case, two adults can ride together on a two-person jet ski, whereas a single adult requires his or her own jet ski, and therefore the unit price is slightly higher for the single adult.\n\n|

for a product, such as *adult*, *child*, *infant*, etc., are returned by the [/product](#operation/product) service. The customer can select a different number of people from each age band during the price check and checkout process.\n\n### Why have age bands?\n\nTour and experience product operators can set different prices for (and impose different rules on) those wishing to make a booking for their product according to how old they are. \n\nFor example, suppliers might choose to charge people 18 years and older ('adults') the full ticket price, while 'children' can book at a lower price. \n\nOr, the tour operator may only allow children to make a group booking for the tour so long as the group contains 'at least one adult'.\n\nViator provides five categories (age bands) that product operators can use to segregate travelers into age groups (the limits of which they also define) in order to set pricing and traveler-count participation rules for their product according to the age band categories.\n\n### Supported age band categories\n\nThe age bands supported by the Viator API are as follows:\n\n| `bandId` | Description |\n|:------:|-------|\n| **1** | Adult |\n| **2** | Child |\n| **3** | Infant |\n| **4** | Youth |\n| **5** | Senior |\n\nThe names and corresponding numeric identifiers of these categories are fixed as in the table above (i.e., `1` is always `Adult`); however, the exact age range to which each category pertains must be defined manually by the supplier.\n\nThe maximum and minimum ages that each age band describes for each product can be retrieved from the [/product](#operation/product) service.\n\n### Example of age band definitions\n\nFor example, a call to [/product](#operation/product) regarding `10040WORLD` yields the following `ageBands` array within its response object:\n\n```javascript\n\"ageBands\": [\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 1,\n    \"ageFrom\": 13,\n    \"ageTo\": 64,\n    \"adult\": true,\n    \"bandId\": 1,\n    \"pluralDescription\": \"Adults\",\n    \"treatAsAdult\": true,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"description\": \"Adult\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 2,\n    \"ageFrom\": 65,\n    \"ageTo\": 99,\n    \"adult\": false,\n    \"bandId\": 5,\n    \"pluralDescription\": \"Seniors\",\n    \"treatAsAdult\": true,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"description\": \"Senior\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 3,\n    \"ageFrom\": 4,\n    \"ageTo\": 12,\n    \"adult\": false,\n    \"bandId\": 2,\n    \"pluralDescription\": \"Children\",\n    \"treatAsAdult\": false,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"description\": \"Child\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sortOrder\": 4,\n    \"ageFrom\": 0,\n    \"ageTo\": 3,\n    \"adult\": false,\n    \"bandId\": 3,\n    \"pluralDescription\": \"Infants\",\n    \"treatAsAdult\": false,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"description\": \"Infant\"\n  }\n```\n\nFor this product, the age bands have been defined as follows:\n\n| `bandId` | `description` | `ageFrom` | `ageTo` |\n|:--------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| **1** | Adult | 13 | 64 |\n| **5** | Senior | 65 | 99 |\n| **2** | Child | 4 | 12 |\n| **3** | Infant | 0 | 3 |\n\nProduct operators must define at least one age band for their tour, and there are no 'default' age ranges. Therefore, if the product operator has only specified a single 'adult' age band covering ages 18-99, it must be assumed that only people aged 18-99 are eligible to book the tour, essentially excluding children and centenarians in this case.\n\n| Field | Type | Definition |\n|-------|------|------|\n| `sortOrder` | integer | the sort order for *this* age band |\n| `adult` | boolean | `true` if this age band is the 'adult' age band |\n| `treatAsAdult` | boolean | `true` if this age band can book the tour without the need for adult accompaniment |\n\n**Note**: `bandId` must be supplied in the request body of the following services:\n\n- [/booking/availability](#operation/bookingAvailability)\n- [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades)\n- [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice)\n- [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook)\n\nAge bands are referenced by their `bandId` in the responses from the following services:\n\n- [/product](#operation/product)\n- [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades)\n- [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgradesPricingmatrix)\n- [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook)\n- [/booking/pastbooking](#operation/bookingPastbooking)\n- [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings)\n- [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice)\n\n## How to report a product issue\n\nOccasionally, a product schema in the Viator database will contain incorrect or invalid information. Usually, this occurs due to a mistake made by the supplier of the product when creating the product or updating its details.\n\nNonetheless, it's in all our best interests for product information to be accurate and up-to-date; therefore, if you discover a problem with a product, we would greatly appreciate it if you could report the error through our [product issue reporting form](https://www.tfaforms.com/433240).\n\n### How to use the product issue reporting form\n\n1. Navigate to the [product issue reporting page](https://www.tfaforms.com/433240)\n2. Fill in the **Reporter**, **Supplier ID**, **Product Code** and **Booking ID** fields:\n\n| Field | How to fill it in | Example |\n|-------|-------------------|---------|\n| Reporter | Enter your email address for tracking or correspondence | `you@emailserver.com` |\n| Supplier ID | Enter the value returned in the `supplierCode` field by the [/product](#operation/product) service for the product in question. | `3072` |\n| Product Code | Enter the value returned in the `code` field by the [/product](#operation/product) service for the product in question. | `3072LASALL` |\n| Booking ID | Leave this field blank | |\n\n3. In the **Reason** box below, choose **Content** by clicking on its radio selector. A list of categories will appear, with meanings as follows:\n\n| Category | Included issues | \n|----------|---------|\n| Additional Info | clauses in the `additionalInfo` array in the response from [/product](#operation/product); e.g., departure time or hotel pick-up information |\n| Availability &amp; Blockouts | N/A |\n| Booking Details | N/A |\n| Highlights | `highlights` array items in the response from [/product](#operation/product) |\n| Inclusions / Exclusions | `inclusions` or `exclusions` array items in the response from [/product](#operation/product) |\n| Images | `productPhotos` and `userPhotos` returned by [/product](#operation/product) or [/product/photos](#operation/productPhotos) |\n| Product Title | `title` in the response from [/product](#operation/product), [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts), [/search/products/codes](#operation/searchProductsCodes) and [/search/products/freetext](#operation/searchFreetext) |\n| Product Descriptions | `description` and `shortDescription` in the response from [/product](#operation/product)|\n| SAPI | N/A |\n| Tour Options &amp; Pricing | pricing issues; e.g. when the value of `merchantNetPrice` is `0`; or, if `merchantNetPrice` &gt; `price` |\n| Taxonomy | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;destination issues in response from [/taxonomy/destination](#operation/taxonomyDestinations)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;category / subcategory issues in response from [/taxonomy/categories](#operation/taxonomyCategories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |\n| Translation Incorrect | mistakes in any natural-language field in the response from any service where `translationLevel` is non-zero |\n| TVRM | N/A |\n| VUC incorrect | N/A |\n\n4.

The customer is only charged once confirmation is received.\n\n#### Access to on-request products\n\nBy default, you will only have access to the freesale product range; access to the on-request product range is restricted on account of the extra complexities involved with handling this kind of booking.\n\n### Should I elect to sell on-request products?\n\n#### Business case for including on-request products in your inventory\n\nWhile the majority of products in our inventory are 'freesale', a significant proportion remain 'on-request'. Upgrading your booking platform to support on-request products can lead to an increase in revenue of between 5% and 13%, depending on the locale(s) in which you operate.\n\n| Locale | Revenue increase % |\n|:------:|:------------------------:|\n| en | 8% |\n| es | 8% |\n| fr | 11% |\n| de | 10% |\n| pt | 5% |\n| nl | 12% |\n| it | 10% |\n| ja | 10% |\n| sv | 8% |\n| no | 8% |\n| da | 13% |\n| tw | 13% |\n| zh | 6% |\n\nHaving a wider range of products on offer can be a key differentiator with respect to your competitors. \n\nCustomers often purchase multiple products in the same session – if the product they're looking for isn't available on your platform, they are likely to seek a competitor with a more complete range of products for sale.\n\n#### Logistical considerations to enable on-request products\n\nIn order to sell on-request products, you will need to:\n\n- Modify your back-end systems to support extra logic and API requests\n- Establish and support an extra, email-based communications channel with your customers\n- Create some email templates\n- Modify your platform's front end to accommodate the extra steps required in the booking process\n- Write copy that ensures customers clearly understand that they are booking a product that will not be confirmed or charged immediately\n\nHowever, as the on-request booking confirmation process is fully automated, you will not need to:\n\n- Undertake any additional manual steps compared with booking a freesale product\n- Personally contact the product supplier or our partner support team\n\nInstead, checking the status of bookings (whether confirmed or not) can be accomplished using the [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus) and [/booking/status/items](#operation/bookingStatusItems) services. These services can be polled periodically to determine the confirmation status of your bookings.\n\n&lt;u&gt;**Note**&lt;/u&gt;: We recommend using the [/booking/status/items](#operation/bookingStatusItems) service to poll for booking statuses, as it is both faster and can be polled more frequently than [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus), which can only be polled once every thirty minutes.\n\n### How to support on-request products\n\n#### Product detail page\n\nManaging customer expectations is a key factor in supporting on-request products on your booking platform. \n\nMake clear mention that this is a product for which confirmation will not be received immediately, but rather within 48 hours of making the booking.\n\nThis fact, as well as other pertinent tidbits, can be found in the `additionalInfo` array in the response from **/product**. It is mandatory that all clauses in the `additionalInfo` array are clearly displayed on your product detail page.\n\n&lt;figure&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/additional-info-on-request-clause.jpg\" alt=\"Additional info displayed on a product page on the Viator site\"/&gt;\n    &lt;figcaption&gt;Additional info displayed on a product page on the Viator site\n     &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n#### Check-out\n\nAs you will only charge the customer's credit card once the on-request booking is confirmed (i.e., after we have received confirmation of the booking from the product supplier) it's best to display a message to this effect at a prominent point of the check-out flow for all on-request products.\n\n&lt;figure&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/checkout-flow-confirmation-info.jpg\" alt=\"Example checkout-flow instruction on the Viator site\"/&gt;\n    &lt;figcaption&gt;Example checkout-flow instruction on the Viator site&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\nIn this way, customers can be reassured that they are not being charged for a booking that may never be confirmed, thereby minimizing needless calls to your customer service team.\n\n#### Combination purchases\n\nIf a single booking includes both freesale (instantly confirmed) and on-request products, only the amount for the freesale product should be charged immediately; the portion corresponding to the on-request booking should only be charged once confirmation is received. \n\nUntil that time, a pre-authorization should be held against the customer’s credit card until confirmation is received.\n\nIt is important that you clearly differentiate between products that are confirmed and those that are pending confirmation, and communicate the status of each and that the pre-authorization will only finalize once the on-request products are confirmed.\n\n#### Confirmation page\n\nChanges will need to be made to your confirmation page because it will not be possible for your customer to download a voucher after completing an on-request booking.\n\nVouchers for freesale products, however, must be made available immediately following the completion of the booking process.\n\n#### Email communications\n\nYou will need to create email templates for &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; the following scenarios:\n\n- Confirmation emails for bookings with on-request products should indicate that the item is pending confirmation from the supplier; and, that confirmation for this activity will take up to 48 hours, depending on availability.\n- If the on-request booking is confirmed by the supplier (this time including the voucher details)\n- If the on-request booking is rejected\n- If multiple on-request products have been booked:\n    + If all items have been accepted/confirmed\n    + If all items were rejected\n    + If there is a mixture of acceptance and rejection; i.e., 'pending' + 'rejected' + 'cancelled' + 'amended' and so forth.\n- If a mixture of freesale and on-request products are booked at the same time; i.e., in the same cart or booking\n\n&lt;u&gt;**Note**&lt;/u&gt;: When a booking is declined, it is useful to mention that the customer's card was not charged.\n\n##### Example email for an on-request booking pending confirmation:\n\n&lt;figure&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/on-request-confirmation-email-1.jpg\" alt=\"Viator website showing translation attribution\"/&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/on-request-confirmation-email-2.jpg\" alt=\"Viator website showing translation attribution\"/&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/on-request-confirmation-email-3.jpg\" alt=\"Viator website showing translation attribution\"/&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n### Confirmation time-outs resulting in rejection\n\nAs mentioned above, once a booking for an on-request product is made, it remains in a 'pending' state, awaiting confirmation by the supplier. The supplier has the option of 'confirming' or 'rejecting' the booking.\n\nSuch bookings will not remain 'pending' indefinitely, however. If the supplier has not confirmed the booking within 72 hours –&nbsp;or if they have not confirmed the booking by the time it reaches 24 hours from departure – our systems will automatically reject the booking, and this will be reflected in the response from the [/booking/status/items](#operation/bookingStatusItems) and [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus) services.\n\nThere will be no indication that the rejection occurred on account of the supplier being unable to perform their duties. Therefore, you should simply inform the customer that, for reasons out of your control, this on-request tour was unavailable.\n\n### Building in the sandbox environment\n\nUpgrading your booking platform to support on-request products will require you to build and test this functionality in the sandbox environment. However, as no actual booking requests are made with the supplier when using a sandbox-only API-key, you will need to contact our API tech support team at [apitechsupport@viator.com](mailto:apitechsupport@viator.com) and request that the booking be confirmed or rejected as you require.\n\nWhile necessary, this is a manual process. We'd genuinely appreciate your effort in keeping the number of these requests to a minimum.\n\n### Certification and going live\n\nOnce you have completed all tasks mentioned here and sent your Viator account manager the email copy for the different scenarios [described above](#email-communications), we will change the status of your product API-key to include on-request products.\n\n## Localization and translation\n\n### Foreign language products\n\nThe products available through the Viator API have been created in a variety of languages, often by the suppliers of those products themselves. \n\nAlthough the majority of these have been created in English, many have been created in other languages. For example, a tour that operates in Paris might have been created in French.\n\nViator provides translation services to localize product descriptions to the language of the locale in which they are being presented. In this way, products with descriptions – for example, in French – can be displayed in English on English-language websites. Conversely, products with English-language-descriptions can be displayed in French on French-language websites.\n\n * **Note**: product descriptions are translated into the language specified in the `Accept-Language` header parameter in the request to each endpoint. \n\n### Human and machine translation\n\nSome products have been translated by actual humans – 'human translated' –  while others have been automatically translated using Google Translate – 'machine translated'.\n\nThe type of translation that has been applied to a product (if any) is indicated by its `translationLevel`, a numeric specifer with meanings as follows:\n\n| `translationLevel` | Meaning |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| `0` | The product was created by the supplier in the language you specifed using the `Accept-Language` header parameter in the request; i.e., the natural-language text in this response has not been translated |\n| `80` | All product information has been &lt;u&gt;machine translated&lt;/u&gt; |\n| `90` or `100` | All product information has been &lt;u&gt;human translated&lt;/u&gt; |\n\nTherefore, any product with a non-zero `translationLevel` has been translated either by a human or via an automatic process.\n\nThe `translationLevel` field is returned in the response objects from the following services:\n\n* [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts)\n* [/search/products/codes](#operation/searchProductsCodes)\n* [/search/freetext](#operation/searchFreetext)\n* [/product](#operation/product)\n* [/available/products](#operation/availableProducts)\n\nWhen performing a product search using any of these services, you will receive - by default - products with a `translationLevel` of:\n\n* `0` (products that are in the language you specified in `Accept-Language` and are configured for your API-keys), and\n* `90` or `100` (products that have been &lt;u&gt;fully human translated&lt;/u&gt;)\n\n### Accessing machine-translated products\n\nIf your implementation can support the large number of products available that are machine translated, you can.\n\nHowever, access to the considerable volume of machine-translated products (level `80`), is &lt;u&gt;not granted by default&lt;/u&gt;.\n\nTo access machine-translated products, you will need to: \n\n1. Request access to machine-translated products in sandbox from your Business Development account manager.\n2. Test your site with sandbox to ensure that you can download and display all the available content.\n3. Have your Business Development account manager review your implementation and grant access in the production environment.\n\n## Merchant pricing\n\nMany of the endpoints in the Viator API return pricing information. Due to the necessity of supporting legacy implementations, some pricing fields may not be named in an intuitive way.\n\nThis section seeks to clarify what each of the pricing fields returned by each endpoint actually refer to and how you need to use this information in your implementation.\n\n### Categories of pricing\n\n| Category | Meaning |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Suggested retail price** | The recommended retail price for the product and the price that the product is sold at on the Viator site |\n| **Merchant net rate** | The amount that Viator will invoice the merchant for this sale, **excluding the transaction fee** |\n| **Merchant total price** | The total amount that Viator will invoice the merchant for this sale, **including the transaction fee** |\n\n| Service | Suggested retail price | Merchant net rate |\n|---------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) | `price`, `priceFormatted` | `merchantNetPriceFrom`, `merchantNetPriceFromFormatted` |\n| [/product](#operation/product) | `price`, `priceFormatted`, `priceFrom`, `priceFromFormatted` | `merchantNetPriceFrom`, `merchantNetPriceFromFormatted` |\n| [/booking/availability](#operation/bookingAvailability) | `retailPrice`, `retailPriceFormatted` | `merchantNetPrice`, `merchantNetPriceFormatted` |\n| [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) | `retailPrice`, `retailPriceFormatted` | `merchantNetPrice`, `merchantNetPriceFormatted` |\n| [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgradesPricingmatrix) | `price`, `priceFormatted` | `merchantNetPrice`, `merchantNetPriceFormatted` |\n| [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) | N/A | `merchantNetPrice`, `merchantNetPriceFormatted`, `lastRetailPrice`, `lastRetailPriceFormatted` |\n| [/booking/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingPricingmatrix) | `price`, `priceFormatted` | `merchantNetPrice`, `merchantNetPriceFormatted` |\n| [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice) | N/A | `merchantNetPrice`, `merchantNetPriceFormatted`, `lastRetailPrice`, `lastRetailPriceFormatted`, `itineraryFromPrice`, `itineraryFromPriceFormatted`, `itineraryNewPrice`, `itineraryNewPriceFormatted` |\n| [/booking/pastbooking](#operation/bookingPastbooking) | N/A | `merchantNetPrice`, `merchantNetPriceFormatted`, `lastRetailPrice`, `lastRetailPriceFormatted`,  |\n| [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings) | N/A | `merchantNetPrice`, `merchantNetPriceFormatted`, `lastRetailPrice`, `lastRetailPriceFormatted` |\n\nThe following services return the **merchant total price** (i.e., the merchant net rate + transaction fee) in the fields shown:\n\n| Service | Merchant total price fields |\n|---------|-----------------------------|\n| [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) | `price`, `priceFormatted`, `totalPrice`, `totalPriceFormatted`, `priceUSD`, `totalPriceUSD` |\n| [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice) | `price`, `priceFormatted`, `priceUSD`, `totalPrice`, `totalPriceFormatted`, `totalPriceUSD` |\n| [/booking/pastbooking](#operation/bookingPastbooking) | `price`, `priceFormatted`, `totalPrice`, `totalPriceFormatted`, `priceUSD`, `totalPriceUSD`, |\n| [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings) | `price`, `priceFormatted`, `priceUSD`, `totalPrice`, `totalPriceFormatted`, `totalPriceUSD` |\n\n### Using the pricing fields\n\nLet's have a look at the various pricing fields for a specific product - the Grand Canyon All-American Helicopter Tour (product code: 2280AAHT).\n\nA search for this product (at the time of writing) on the Viator.com site gives the 'from' price of the tour as **$601.11**:\n\n&lt;figure&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/suggested-retail-price.jpg\" alt=\"'from' price on viator.com product detail page\"/&gt;\n    &lt;figcaption&gt;Retail price shown on viator.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\nThis value comes from the `price` or `priceFormatted` fields in the response from [/product](#operation/product) for this tour; i.e.,:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  ...,\n  \"price\": 601.11,\n  \"priceFormatted\": \"$601.11\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nEssentially, this value is the price that the product is sold at on the viator site, and is therefore the **suggested retail price**; i.e., the price at which we recommend you advertise and sell the product for.\n\nIt is also the price of the tour grade with the lowest price; in this case, the \"Earlybird A-Star\" tour grade detailed here:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"sortOrder\": 5,\n    \"currencyCode\": \"AUD\",\n    \"langServices\": {\n        \"en/SERVICE_AUDIO\": \"English - Audio\"\n    },\n    \"gradeCode\": \"EB_ASTAR_SP\",\n    \"merchantNetPriceFrom\": 555.37,\n    \"priceFrom\": 601.11,\n    \"priceFromFormatted\": \"$601.11\",\n    \"merchantNetPriceFromFormatted\": \"$555.37\",\n    \"gradeTitle\": \"Special: Earlybird A-Star\",\n    \"gradeDepartureTime\": \"\",\n    \"gradeDescription\": \"Special Offer: Receive a discounted seat for the Grand Canyon All American Helicopter Tour departing between 6:45am and 7am on an A-Star helicopter\",\n    \"defaultLanguageCode\": \"en\"\n},\n```\n\nAs you can see, the \"suggested retail price\" is given in the `priceFrom` field.\n\n#### Low and zero-margin products\n\nWhen setting the retail price at which you sell products on your site, it’s important to remember that the “suggested sell price” is the price at which the product is currently advertised on the Viator site and reflects the current standard industry price for the product. It &lt;u&gt;does not&lt;/u&gt; take into consideration the merchant net price (i.e., the price at which you as a merchant partner will be invoiced for the sale) and, in the case of discounting scenarios, may in fact be less than the merchant net price.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that you sell the product at a price which guarantees that you receive at least as much as you will be invoiced for, as well as any extra profit margin that you desire to generate, we recommend you include a check in your implementation that these requirements are satisfied by comparing the suggested retail and merchant net prices and adjusting the retail price at which you advertise the product accordingly.\n\nFor example, if the merchant net price for a product is $100, the suggested sell price is $101, and your requirement for a minimum margin is 5%, you should adjust the price at which you advertise the product to $105.\n\nWhile we recommend that you charge your customers this amount, it is ultimately up to you as to the price you set for the product, bearing in mind that  Viator will then invoice you for the **merchant net rate** (`merchantNetPriceFrom`) of $555.37 &lt;u&gt;plus&lt;/u&gt; a **transaction fee** calculated as a percentage of the net rate; i.e., the **merchant total price**. \n\n**The exact value of this transaction fee is detailed in your contract with Viator.**\n\n## Special offers and on-sale pricing\n\nSuppliers have the option of setting special pricing deals for their products. When a product is 'on sale'; i.e., has a temporarily lowered price, it will be reflected in the product content response, as follows:\n\n| Field name | Standard pricing | Special offer / on-sale pricing |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------------|\n| `specialOfferAvailable` | `false` | `true` |\n| `specialOffer` | `\"\"` (empty string) | e.g.: `\"Book by February 28 to save 10%\"` |\n| `rrp` | `0.0` | pre-discount price |\n| `rrpFormatted` | `\"\"` (empty string) | currency-formatted pre-discount price |\n| `price` | standard price | special offer price |\n| `priceFormatted` | currency-formatted **standard price** | currency-formatted **special-offer price** |\n| `merchantNetPriceFrom` | standard merchant net rate | special offer merchant net rate |\n| `merchantNetPriceFromFormatted` | currency formatted standard merchant net rate | currency formatted special offer merchant net rate |\n| `priceFormatted` | currency-formatted **standard price** | currency-formatted **special-offer price** |\n| `priceFrom` (in `tourgrades`) | standard price | special offer price |\n| `priceFromFormatted` (in `tourgrades`) | currency-formatted **standard price** | currency-formatted **special-offer price** |\n\nYou can use this information to highlight which products are on special and provide details to the user about the special offer.\n\n## Supplier communications\n\n### How can suppliers communicate with end customers?\n\nSuppliers occasionally need to reach out to customers for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\n* Requesting pick-up locations, flight details or passenger weight information\n* Providing weather alerts, sold-out notifications or general messaging\n\nTo allow suppliers to contact customers directly, Viator provides a **Closed Loop Communication (CLC)** system. \n\n### How to enable CLC\n\nCLC is enabled per-booking and at the time of booking by supplying the customer’s `email` and either `homePhone` or [`cellphone` + `cellPhoneCountryCode`] – or both – in the `booker` object in the request body sent to the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service when making a booking.\n\nThis will allow suppliers to send CLC messages directly to the end customer.\n\n#### Note:\n\n* You will receive a CC of each supplier message to your customer support email address in case further assistance is required, but no action from your support team will be necessary for suppliers to communicate with customers.\n\n* Merchants choosing this option should mention to their customers that they are purchasing a product from a third-party supplier, and that they may therefore receive communications regarding the purchase directly from that supplier. \n\n#### Example request body snippet to enable direct CLC\n```javascript\n{\n    ...\n    \"booker\": {\n        \"homePhone\": \"(02)66987564\",\n        \"firstname\": \"Homer Test\",\n        \"surname\": \"Simpson Test\",\n        \"title\": \"Mr\",\n        \"cellPhoneCountryCode\": \"61\",\n        \"cellPhone\": \"431532778\",\n        \"email\": \"hsimpson@customeremail.com\"\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Supplier communications without CLC\n\nTo have CLCs from the supplier sent &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; to your (the merchant's) customer support team:\n\n* Leave the `cellPhone`, `cellPhoneCountryCode` and `homePhone` fields blank in the request to the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service when making a booking.\n\n**Note:** Utilizing this option requires merchants to manage the final loop of communication with the end customer to ensure that their tour/activity can be fulfilled successfully.\n\n## Cancellation policy\n\nAs well as *making* bookings, merchant partners are also able to *cancel* bookings through the Viator API using the [/bookings/cancel-reasons](#operation/cancellationReasons), [/bookings/{booking-ref}/cancel-quote](#operation/cancelBookingQuote) and [/bookings/{booking-ref}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking) endpoints. Items cancelled via the [/bookings/{booking-ref}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking) endpoint will be cancelled in full, and only one booking can be cancelled at a time.\n\nFor more information about the content of the new `merchantTermsAndConditions` object, see [Cancellation policy](#section/Key-concepts/Cancellation-policy).\n\n\n### Cancellation policies\n\nAll products can be cancelled by the merchant; however, the refund granted by the supplier to the customer differs depending on the cancellation policy for the product in question.\n\nThere are &lt;u&gt;three&lt;/u&gt; cancellation policy categories, **standard**, **custom** and **all sales final**, represented by an integer in the `merchantTermsAndConditionsType` field in the `merchantTermsAndConditions` object returned by [/product](#operation/product): `1`, `2` or `3`, respectively.\n\n**Note:** *These policies are those provided by Viator to our merchant partners. Merchants can choose whether to extend these terms to their customers unchanged or set their own cancellation terms. For example, the merchant partner can choose to make all products non-refundable; or, they might change the full-refund cancellation window to 72 hours instead of 24 hours, and so forth.*\n\n### `1` – Standard cancellation policy\nProducts in this category are cancellable up to 24 hours before the travel date (local supplier time) for a full refund. However, a &lt;u&gt;100% cancellation penalty&lt;/u&gt; applies for cancellations submitted less than 24 hours before the start time. Most products (about 85%) fall into this category.\n\n#### Example response snippet\n\n- **Source endpoint**: [/product](#operation/product)\n- **Product**: `5010SYDNEY`\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"merchantTermsAndConditions\": {\n      \"termsAndConditions\": \"For a full refund, cancel at least 24 hours in advance of the start date of the experience.\",\n      \"merchantTermsAndConditionsType\": 1,\n      \"amountRefundable\": null,\n      \"cancellationFromTourDate\": [\n        {\n          \"dayRangeMin\": 0,\n          \"dayRangeMax\": 1,\n          \"percentageRefundable\": 0,\n          \"policyStartTimestamp\": null,\n          \"policyEndTimestamp\": null\n        },\n        {\n          \"dayRangeMin\": 1,\n          \"dayRangeMax\": null,\n          \"percentageRefundable\": 100,\n          \"policyStartTimestamp\": null,\n          \"policyEndTimestamp\": null\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"...\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis product has the *standard* cancellation policy; i.e., when a booking is cancelled:\n\n| Policy | **dayRangeMin** | **dayRangeMax** | Logic | **percentageRefundable** |\n|--------|:-----------:|:-----------:|-------|:--------------------------:|\n| *less than* &lt;u&gt;one&lt;/u&gt; day (24 hours) before the start time | 0 | 1 | (product_start_time - cancellation_time) &gt;= 0 days &amp;&amp; (product_start_time - cancellation_time) &lt; 1 days | 0 |\n| *more than* &lt;u&gt;one&lt;/u&gt; day (24 hours) before the start time | 1 | null | (product_start_time - cancellation_time) &gt;= 1 day | 100 |\n\n### `2` – Custom cancellation policy\nThe refund amount for products in this category varies depending on how long before its start time the product is cancelled. Many products on a custom policy are multi-day tours, which require more sophisticated planning on the supplier’s end. Only a small number of products (around 5%) fall into this category.\n\n#### Example response snippet\n\n- **Source endpoint**: [/product](#operation/product)\n- **Product**: `2264RJ410`\n\n```javascript\n\"data\": {\n  \"merchantTermsAndConditions\": {\n    \"termsAndConditions\": \"If you cancel at least 30 day(s) in advance of the scheduled departure, there is no cancellation fee.&lt;br&gt;If you cancel between 10 and 29 day(s) in advance of the scheduled departure, there is a 50 percent cancellation fee.&lt;br&gt;If you cancel within 9 day(s) of the scheduled departure, there is a 100 percent cancellation fee.&lt;br&gt;\",\n    \"merchantTermsAndConditionsType\": 2,\n    \"amountRefundable\": null,\n    \"cancellationFromTourDate\": [\n      {\n        \"dayRangeMin\": 10,\n        \"dayRangeMax\": 30,\n        \"percentageRefundable\": 50,\n        \"policyStartTimestamp\": null,\n        \"policyEndTimestamp\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"dayRangeMin\": 30,\n        \"dayRangeMax\": null,\n        \"percentageRefundable\": 100,\n        \"policyStartTimestamp\": null,\n        \"policyEndTimestamp\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"dayRangeMin\": 0,\n        \"dayRangeMax\": 10,\n        \"percentageRefundable\": 0,\n        \"policyStartTimestamp\": null,\n        \"policyEndTimestamp\": null\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"...\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nThis product has a complex cancellation policy; where cancellations processed:\n\n| Policy | **dayRangeMin** | **dayRangeMax** | Logic | **percentageRefundable** |\n|--------|:-----------:|:-----------:|-------|:--------------------------:|\n| &lt;u&gt;30&lt;/u&gt; days or more before the start time | 30 | null | (product_start_time - cancellation_time) &gt;= 30 days | 100 |\n| &lt;u&gt;10&lt;/u&gt; days and *less than* &lt;u&gt;30&lt;/u&gt; days (10 to 30 days) *before* the start time or more | 10 | 30 | (product_start_time - cancellation_time) &gt;= 10 days &amp;&amp; (product_start_time - cancellation_time) &lt; 30 days | 50 |\n| *less than* &lt;u&gt;10&lt;/u&gt; days *before* the start time | 0 | 10 | (product_start_time - cancellation_time) &lt; 10 days | 0 |\n\n**Note:** `null` in the `dateRangeMax` field means *negative infinity*; i.e., *infinitely far in the past with respect to* `dateRangeMin`.\n\nAdditional clauses will be included in the `termsAndConditions` field in natural language. This field is for human consumption and is not classically machine-interpretable.\n\n### `3` – All sales final (100% cancellation penalty / no refund offered)\n\nProducts in this category cannot be cancelled or amended without incurring a 100% penalty; i.e., the refund amount will be zero. Around 10% of products fall into this category.\n\n#### Example response snippet\n\n- **Source endpoint**: [/product](#operation/product)\n- **Product**: `5985P7`\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"merchantTermsAndConditions\": {\n      \"termsAndConditions\": \"All sales are final and incur 100% cancellation penalties.&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"merchantTermsAndConditionsType\": 3,\n      \"amountRefundable\": null,\n      \"cancellationFromTourDate\": [\n        {\n          \"dayRangeMin\": 0,\n          \"dayRangeMax\": null,\n          \"percentageRefundable\": 0,\n          \"policyStartTimestamp\": null,\n          \"policyEndTimestamp\": null\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"...\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n```\nProducts in this category can be cancelled, but no refund will be granted (in most cases...)\n\n### Canceling items with a 'pending' booking status\n\nAs alluded, there is an exception to this rule. Products with an 'on-request' [booking type](#section/Key-concepts/Booking) can still be cancelled when their booking status is `\"pending\"` – i.e., before the supplier has confirmed the booking – and a full refund will be granted.\n\nIt is impossible to predict how long an 'on-request' booking will remain 'pending'. However, it is possible to check by enquiring about the booking using one of the post-booking services; i.e.:\n\n* [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus)\n* [/booking/status/items](#operation/bookingStatusItems)\n* [/booking/pastbooking](#operation/bookingPastbooking)\n* [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings)\n\nAn 'all sales final' product in a 'pending' state that can be cancelled and a refund granted will have the following characteristics:\n\n1. The `bookingStatus` object returned from one of the services above will have a `type` of `\"PENDING\"`, and `pending` will be `true`.\n2. The `amountRefundable` field of the `merchantTermsAndConditions` object will be non-zero and non-null. Rather, it will contain a currency-formatted string showing the amount that would be refunded if the cancellation were performed immediately; e.g., \"USD 55.33\".\n\n\n### Policy start and end times\n\nWithin the `merchantTermsAndConditions` object returned in the response from [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook), [/booking/pastbooking](#operation/bookingPastbooking) and [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings), the `amountRefundable` field shows the amount of money in the selected currency that will be refunded if the cancellation is processed now, while the `policyStartTimestamp` and `policyEndTimestamp` fields indicate the exact times between which the different cancellation refund rates apply.\n\n#### Example response snippet (`merchantTermsAndConditions`) from [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook)\n\n- **Product**: `5010SYDNEY`\n- **Note**: observe that `amountRefundable`, `policyStartTimestamp` and `policyEndTimestamp` are populated here.\n\n```javascript\n\"data\": {\n  \"merchantTermsAndConditions\": {\n    \"termsAndConditions\": \"For a full refund, cancel at least 24 hours in advance of the start date of the experience.\",\n    \"amountRefundable\": \"USD 55.33\",\n    \"cancellationFromTourDate\": [\n      {\n        \"dayRangeMin\": 1,\n        \"dayRangeMax\": null,\n        \"percentageRefundable\": 100,\n        \"policyStartTimestamp\": null,\n        \"policyEndTimestamp\": 1551513600000\n      },\n      {\n        \"dayRangeMin\": 0,\n        \"dayRangeMax\": 1,\n        \"percentageRefundable\": 0,\n        \"policyStartTimestamp\": 1551340800000,\n        \"policyEndTimestamp\": 1551427200000\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"...\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\n### Post-travel cancellations\n\nOccasionally, customers seek a refund for a product **after** completing their travels.\n\nThe reason for this might be because they were unable to attend the tour due to the supplier having cancelled the tour due to bad weather or some other reason out of the customer's control; or, the customer might have been extremely dissatisfied with the tour itself, felt that it was misrepresented in its advertising, or some other serious complaint.\n\nWhen this occurs, you will need to [send a refund request by email to dpsupport](mailto:dpsupport@viator.com) and include both \"CANCEL\" and the booking reference number in the subject line.\n\nFor **all** post-travel cancellation requests, you will need to include a detailed description of the issue. \n\nExcept in cases of known service interruptions (e.g., due to extreme weather events), we will first verify the issue and seek authorization from the product supplier. \n\nOnce a decision regarding the refund has been made, we will notify your Customer Services Department with this information. You will then need to advise your customer directly and process the refund if granted.\n\n### Interpreting `policyStartTimestamp` and `policyEndTimestamp`\n\nThe integers that populate the `policyStartTimestamp` and `policyEndTimestamp` fields represent points in time that mark the boundaries of the policy time period in the [Unix time format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time); i.e., the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Thursday, 1 January 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), minus leap seconds.\n\nUnix timestamps can be easily read and interpreted using the 'time' (or similar) library of your favorite programming language. For human purposes, an [online conversion tool](https://www.epochconverter.com/) can be used.\n\nAs per the example above, canceling this booking between the following times yields zero refund (because it is within the 24 hour window):\n\n| **Field name** | `policyStartTimestamp` | `policyEndTimestamp` |\n|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Unix time** | 1551340800000 | 1551427200000 |\n| **Human readable time** | GMT: Thursday, February 28, 2019 8:00:00 AM | GMT: Friday, March 1, 2019 8:00:00 AM |\n\n* **Note**: Please use `policyStartTimestamp` and `policyEndTimestamp`, rather than `dayRangeMin` and `dayRangeMax`, to determine which cancellation policy is in effect.\n\n### Partial refunds\n\nWhile we recommend that you, as a merchant partner, support the processing of partial refunds for your customers, it is up to your whether you implement this functionality. \n\nIf you would prefer to only grant the full (100%) refund that is offered on most products so long as the cancellation is processed more than 24 hours prior to the product's start time, we recommend that you implement logic that checks whether a 100% refund is available for the product at the time the customer wishes to cancel their booking.\n\n| **Type 1: Standard policy** (`merchantTermsAndConditionsType` is `1`) |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The 100% refund is available so long as the cancellation is performed more than 24 hours prior to the product start time |\n\n| **Type 2: Custom policy** (`merchantTermsAndConditionsType` is `2`) |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| You will need to check whether any of the object-items in the `cancellationFromTourDate` array have: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a `percentageRefundable` value of `100`, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`dayRangeMin` and `dayRangeMax` **or** `policyStartTimestamp` and `policyEndTimestamp` values that include the present time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |\n\n| **Type 3: All sales final** (`merchantTermsAndConditionsType` is `3`) |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| No refunds are available; therefore, granting a refund to your customer for this kind of product will be solely at *your* expense (i.e., you will still be invoiced for the cost of the tour by Viator). Therefore, we recommend that you do not allow refunds for products with this policy. |\n\n## Booking references \n\nWhen a booking is made successfully via the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) endpoint, Viator assigns it a numeric identifier, now known as the **booking reference**.\n\nThis booking reference is returned in the service's response in the `itemId` field; however, this `itemId` is found in different locations depending on the endpoint used:\n\n| Endpoint |  itemId element location |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) | `data.itemSummaries[].itemId` |\n| [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus) | `data.itemSummaries[].itemId` |\n| [/booking/status/items](#operation/bookingStatusItems) | `data[].itemId` |\n| [/booking/pastbooking](#operation/bookingPastbooking) | `data.itemSummaries[].itemId` |\n| [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings) | `data[].itemSummaries[].itemId` |\n\nThe booking reference can used in the **request** in the following endpoints as the value in the `itemId` field or in the `itemIds` array:\n\n- [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus)\n- [/booking/status/items](#operation/bookingStatusItems)\n- [/booking/pastbooking](#operation/bookingPastbooking)\n- [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings)\n- [/booking/voucher](#operation/bookingVoucher)\n\n### New booking references\n\nThe new booking cancellation endpoints; i.e.: \n\n- [/bookings/{booking-reference}/cancel-quote](#operation/cancelBookingQuote)\n- [/bookings/{booking-reference}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking)\n\n...use this booking reference value as an in-URL request parameter, but its format is slightly different. \n\nEssentially, it is the booking's numeric identifier (`itemId`), but prepended with `BR-`.  For example, if the `itemId` is `580254558`, the `bookingId` value in the cancellation request should be `BR-580254558`. \n\nThe booking cancellation endpoints confirm the booking reference in the response in the `bookingId` field; e.g.:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bookingId\": \"BR-580669678\",\n  \"refundDetails\": {\n    \"itemPrice\": 412.04,\n    \"refundAmount\": 412.04,\n    \"refundPercentage\": 100,\n    \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\n  },\n  \"status\": \"CANCELLABLE\"\n}\n```\n\n# Common workflows and data validation\n\nUsers of the API usually implement a booking process workflow. The common workflows are:\n- [add to cart](#section/Common-workflows-and-data-validation/Add-to-cart)\n- [checkout](#section/Common-workflows-and-data-validation/Checkout)\n- [view voucher or confirmation status](#section/Common-workflows-and-data-validation/View-voucher-or-confirmation-status)\n- [make a booking](#section/Common-workflows-and-data-validation/Booking-process-flow)\n\n## Add to cart\n\n### Summary\n\nBecause the Viator API is both stateless and does not include services for managing a customer's shopping cart, this functionality must be fully managed on the merchant's side.\n\nViator's servers can generate a price quote for one or several items, but this collection will not be saved by the server.\n\nWe recommend the following process:\n\n1. **View product** - allow the customer to browse products and product details\n2. **Select date and passengers** - allow the customer to check available dates and select the type and number of passengers\n3. **Select tourgrade** - display the available tour grades\n4. **View cart** -&gt; **price quote** - display a total price (including multiple items)\n\n### View product\nFrom your *view product details* section, a button should be presented to **check availability** or **book now** or something similar. Use the [/product](#operation/product) service to retrieve product details and schedules.\n\n### Select date and passengers\nHere, the customer is presented with the dates that remain available for the product. Available dates can be obtained via a request to [/booking/availability/dates](#operation/bookingAvailabilityDates). The list of [age bands](#section/Key-concepts/Working-with-age-bands) (i.e.: 'adult', 'child'; and, each band's maximum and minimum age) is available from the [/product](#operation/product) service.\n\n**Validation** – ensure that:\n1. The total number of travelers being booked does not exceed the limit returned in the `maxTravellerCount` field of the [/product](#operation/product) service\n2. *At least one* adult (or adult equivalent) passenger has been selected\n3. The selected dates are available (use [/booking/availability/dates](#operation/bookingAvailabilityDates))\n\n### Select tour grade\n\nOnce the date and traveler mix have been selected, the customer may need to select a tour grade. Products that do not have this information recorded in the Viator database are assigned a tour grade of `\"DEFAULT\"`. For these products, it is unnecessary to select a tour grade.\n\nTour grade options must be displayed to the customer when the product has multiple tour grades, due to:\n- different departure times\n- traveler mix price deals, like family passes\n- different inclusions and prices - e.g., limo pickup, different language delivery options), or...\n- non-default tour grades – these tour grades *must* be presented to the customer.\n\nThe tour grades for a product are retrieved with the [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) service. If a tour grade is available (check the `available` flag), an 'add to cart' button can be displayed. For unavailable tour grades (`available` is `false`), a reason (`unavailableReason`) is provided, which will be one of:\n\n- `\"TRAVELLER_MISMATCH\"`\n- `\"BLOCKED_OUT\"`, or\n- `\"UNAVAILABLE\"`\n\nYou may choose to hide the blocked-out tour grades (if all tour grades are unavailable on a particular day, a day's tour grades are all `\"BLOCKED_OUT\"`, or the product is not operating that day, the [/booking/availability/dates](#operation/bookingAvailabilityDates) service will not return that date).\n\nYou may also find that a product has no bookable tour grades on a day if the traveler mix does not meet that tour grade's traveler mix restrictions. For example, a honeymoon might require two adults as the only possible traveler mix.\n\nYou can choose to hide the `\"BLOCKED_OUT\"` tour grades, but you will probably want to display the `\"TRAVELLER_MISMATCH\"` grades with the traveler mix requirements listed so that the customer can elect to alter their traveler mix to suit (e.g., for family passes, etc.) You cannot allow the passenger to book with an incompatible traveler mix.\n\nThe return object includes information about tour grade restrictions:\n\n`ageBandsRequired`:\n- `minimumCountRequired`: minimum number of travelers for an [age band](#section/Key-concepts/Working-with-age-bands)\n- `maximumCountRequired`: maximum number of travelers for an [age band](#section/Key-concepts/Working-with-age-bands). If this field is `null`, any number of travelers may be booked.\n\nYou will need to present the `ageBandsRequired` information as in the following examples:\n\n| In 'Adult' age band | Meaning |\n|---------------------|---------|\n| `minimumCountRequired` = 1&lt;br&gt;`maximumCountRequired` = 3 | From 1 to 3 adults |\n| `minimumCountRequired` = 0&lt;br&gt;`maximumCountRequired` = 3 | up to three adults |\n| `minimumCountRequired` = 3&lt;br&gt;`MaximumCountRequired` =  | 3 or more adults |\n| `minimumCountRequired` = 2&lt;br&gt;`MaximumCountRequired` = 2 | 2 adults |\n\n\n**Note:** There is a singular and plural version for each age band definition. We recommend automatically generating language that ensures the samples above are grammatically correct using this information.\n\nThe user can click **back** and change their traveler mix; or, they can try selecting another day.\n\n### View cart / price quote\n\nOnce the item has been added to the cart, you will need to preserve this information as part of the session data in your back-end, or as a browser cookie. In particular, you will need to store the *product code* and *age band to quantity traveler mix*.\n\n#### Sample PHP shopping cart item class\n**Note:** this is only an example and is implementation dependent. Alternatively, you could use the item class (as used in the API calls), but much of the information it contains does not need to be stored:\n\n```javascript\nclass shoppingCartItem {\n  var $productCode;\n  var $tourGrade;\n  var $date;\n  var $ageBandIdToQty; // assoc array\n}\n```\n\nTo obtain a price quote, you must call the [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice) service. This service requires a currency code and an array of items to be specified. Each item contains the date, product code, tour grade code and an associative array of `ageBandIds` -&gt; `quantity`.\n\n**Validation** – the data must contain [valid age bands](#section/Key-concepts/Working-with-age-bands), tour codes, dates, etc. acquired in previous requests to the API.\n\n**Note:** A product's availability can change in the time between API calls as tour grades or products may be blocked out, or the booking window may close for upcoming dates.\n\n## Checkout\n\n### Summary\n\nThe checkout process can be accomplished using the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service, but you may need to make requests to other services to calculate prices, display product information (age-band names, etc.) and list available pick-up hotels for user selection.\n\nThe Viator mobile website breaks the workflow down into three steps. For multiple items, some steps will need to be repeated, such as capturing the traveler names for each tour. In your implementation, you can reorganize/reorder the data collection to better suit your needs.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n1. **Collect traveler details** - collect the names of the lead traveler and all other travelers\n2. **Collect travel details** - ask any additional questions, including those about any special requirements, and select pick-up options.\n  - **Note:** the aforementioned steps will need to be repeated for each item)\n3. **Collect booking details**\n  - **Note:** billing and payment details *should not* be sent to Viator.\n\nThe classes for the booking request are defined here in Booking Data Classes. You will need implement these in your chosen programming language and verify that the correct JSON objects are generated during serialization.\n\n### Traveler details\n\nThe traveler details are used to populate the `booking-&gt;items[]-&gt;travellers[]` objects.\n\nOne passenger must be identified as the \"lead traveler\". A boolean field in the traveler object represents this flag. The lead traveler must be an adult or have the age band `treatAsAdult` flag set to `true`.\n\nAll other travelers must be included.\n\n**Validation** \n\nEnsure that:\n\n  - `bandId` is a [valid age band ID](#section/Key-concepts/Working-with-age-bands) for the product\n  - `firstname` is less than 16 chars\n  - `surname` is less than 36 chars\n  - `title` is not included unnecessarily (it is optional)\n  - `leadTraveller` is set to `true` for one of the travelers who is in an [age band](#section/Key-concepts/Working-with-age-bands) that has the `treatAsAdult` flag set to `true`\n\n### Other details\n\n#### Booking questions\n\nThe travel details include the [booking questions](#section/Appendices/Booking-questions) that are supplied in the [/product](#operation/product) service.\n\n**Sample question**\n\n**Note:** There may be more than one.\n\n```javascript\nbookingQuestions: [{\n  \"message\": \"For safety reasons you must enter the weight of &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; passengers\",\n  \"required\": true,\n  \"questionId\": 23,\n  \"title\": \"Passenger Weights\",\n  \"subTitle\": \"(e.g. 127 pounds, 145 kilos, etc)\",\n  \"sortOrder\": 1\n}]\n```\nThe questions should be displayed with the title, message, subtitle and whether it is mandatory (required) or not.\n\n**Validation** – if the question is mandatory, the user must enter at least one character.\n\n#### Special requirements\n\n'Special requirements' should be presented as a text input field so that customers can record whether they require wheelchair assistance, for example. It is not mandatory for the customer to enter any text.\n\n#### Pick-up information\n\nThe last thing that must be collected for each item being booked is the pick-up information. If the product includes pick-up, the `hotelPickup` flag will be set to `true` (in the product object).\n\nIf pick-up is included, you will need to make a request to [/booking/hotels](#operation/bookingHotels) to determine if a hotel list exists. If it does, the list must be displayed so that the customer can make their selection. If not, a text input field should be displayed for hotel name collection.\n\nPlease note that the *first three results* in the list are *not* hotels; rather, these three are alternative selections, comprising:\n\n- 'Hotel not listed'\n- 'Live locally or staying with family/friends'\n- 'Hotel not yet booked'\n\nIf the customer selects 'hotel not listed', you *must* provide a hotel selection text input field. For the other two options, no hotel name is required. In all cases, the hotel ID must be updated with either a hotel ID or the IDs of the three items listed.\n\nIf no hotel list is available, you must provide a text input field for collecting the customer's hotel name. Please include instructions to enter 'live locally' or 'hotel not yet booked' if they cannot provide a hotel name.\n\n**Validation** – if hotel list is available, the `hotelId` must be supplied. If the `hotelId` is `notListed` the, `pickupPoint` field *must* have at least one character.\n\nIf a hotel list is not available, then `pickupPoint` must contain a value.\n\n#### Language services\n\nIf the response from the [/product](#operation/product) service contains information in the `languageServices` field, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\n\"langServices\": {\n  \"en/SERVICE_AUDIO\": \"English - Audio\"\n}\n```\n\n...you must specify which language option you wish to book for this tour in the `languageOptionCode` field (see request body schema of the [/booking/book service](#operation/bookingBook)).\n\n## View voucher or confirmation status\n\nThe object returned by the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service contains booking details that can be used to display an order summary to the customer.\n\nConfirmed bookings of freesale products will return a `voucherKey` and `voucherURL`. The `voucherURL` is accessible by the customer to view their voucher.\n\nPending bookings of on-request products will return `null` in the `voucherKey`/`voucherURL` fields. These fields will only contain values once the booking is confirmed.\n\nA `bookingStatus` object is included in the response that contains the status of the booking.\n\n```javascript\n\"bookingStatus\": {\n  \"status\": 1,\n  \"text\": \"Paid &amp;amp; Confirmed\",\n  \"type\": \"CONFIRMED\",\n  \"level\": \"ITEM\",\n  \"failed\": false,\n  \"confirmed\": true,\n  \"amended\": false,\n  \"pending\": false,\n  \"cancelled\": false\n}\n```\n\nThe status field corresponds to a number described in [bookingStatus field values and meanings](#section/Appendices/bookingStatus-field-values-and-meanings).\n\nBoolean flags that you can inspect to determine the booking status of the item:\n- `failed`\n- `cancelled`\n- `confirmed`\n- `amended`\n- `pending`\n\n### Pending bookings\nA booking is considered *pending* if the booking process is 'in progress'. For example, an on-request booking would be *pending* until it is confirmed/rejected by the supplier.\n\nIf a customer has made an amendment to an on-request booking that is yet to be accepted by the supplier, the booking would then have a status of *amended* when the supplier or customer service accepts the amendment.\n\n**Example response object:**\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"errorReference\": null,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"sortOrder\": 0,\n    \"rulesApplied\": [],\n    \"bookingStatus\": {\n      \"status\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Confirmed\",\n      \"type\": \"CONFIRMED\",\n      \"level\": \"ITINERARY\",\n      \"confirmed\": true,\n      \"pending\": false,\n      \"amended\": false,\n      \"cancelled\": false,\n      \"failed\": false\n    },\n    \"itemSummaries\": [{\n      \"sortOrder\": 0,\n      \"rulesApplied\": [],\n      \"bookingStatus\": {\n        \"status\": 1,\n        \"text\": \"Paid &amp;amp; Confirmed\",\n        \"type\": \"CONFIRMED\",\n        \"level\": \"ITEM\",\n        \"pending\": false,\n        \"failed\": false,\n        \"confirmed\": true,\n        \"amended\": false,\n        \"cancelled\": false\n      },\n      \"travellerAgeBands\": [{\n        \"sortOrder\": 0,\n        \"count\": 1,\n        \"pluralDescription\": \"Adults\",\n        \"description\": \"Adult\",\n        \"ageBandId\": 1\n      }],\n      \"voucherKey\": \"1005851866:4af44c13ecf3f1a7d3f9ef2fc00c2257e08fa42ae20f877f3039ff9b52aba24e:580669678\",\n      \"voucherURL\": \"https://viatorapi.live.rc.viator.com/service/merchant/voucher.jspa?code=1005851866:4af44c13ecf3f1a7d3f9ef2fc00c2257e08fa42ae20f877f3039ff9b52aba24e:580669678&amp;embedResources=false\",\n      \"voucherRequirements\": \"You must present a paper voucher for this to\",\n      \"productPulledDown\": false,\n      \"merchantCancellable\": true,\n      \"productWidgetList\": null,\n      \"savingAmount\": 0,\n      \"passbooks\": null,\n      \"termsAndConditions\": null,\n      \"itineraryId\": 1000024753,\n      \"tourGradeCode\": \"1DAYBOAT\",\n      \"productCode\": \"2065CPT\",\n      \"leadTravellerSurname\": \"Test\",\n      \"distributorItemRef\": \"distroItemRefJDP1803151135\",\n      \"languageServicesLanguageCode\": \"en\",\n      \"travelDate\": \"2016-02-01\",\n      \"price\": 3.72,\n      \"bookingEngineId\": \"UF\",\n      \"merchantNetPrice\": 3.51,\n      \"merchantNetPriceFormatted\": \"$3.51\",\n      \"leadTravellerTitle\": \"Mr\",\n      \"leadTravellerFirstname\": \"Homer\",\n      \"lastRetailPrice\": 3.51,\n      \"destId\": 318,\n      \"voucherOption\": \"VOUCHER_PAPER_ONLY\",\n      \"productTitle\": \"Cape Town City Hop-on Hop-off Tour\",\n      \"itemId\": 700025496,\n      \"barcodeOption\": \"perperson\",\n      \"barcodeType\": \"code128\",\n      \"obfsId\": 3696,\n      \"priceFormatted\": \"$3.72\",\n      \"savingAmountFormated\": \"\",\n      \"priceUSD\": 3.72,\n      \"lastRetailPriceFormatted\": \"$3.51\",\n      \"departsFrom\": \"Cape Town, South Africa\",\n      \"hoursConfirmed\": 0,\n      \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\n    }],\n    \"voucherKey\": \"1005851866:4af44c13ecf3f1a7d3f9ef2fc00c2257e08fa42ae20f877f3039ff9b52aba24e:580669678\",\n    \"voucherURL\": \"https://viatorapi.live.rc.viator.com/service/merchant/voucher.jspa?code=1005851866:4af44c13ecf3f1a7d3f9ef2fc00c2257e08fa42ae20f877f3039ff9b52aba24e:580669678&amp;embedResources=false\",\n    \"bookerEmail\": \"apitest@viator.com\",\n    \"userId\": null,\n    \"itineraryId\": 1000024753,\n    \"exchangeRate\": 1,\n    \"totalPriceFormatted\": \"$3.51\",\n    \"totalPriceUSD\": 3.51,\n    \"bookingDate\": \"2015-03-17\",\n    \"distributorRef\": \"distroRefJDP1803151135\",\n    \"totalPrice\": 3.51,\n    \"hasVoucher\": true,\n    \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\n  },\n  \"dateStamp\": \"2015-03-17T17:36:32+0000\",\n  \"errorType\": null,\n  \"errorMessage\": null,\n  \"errorName\": null,\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"totalCount\": 1,\n  \"vmid\": \"321003\",\n  \"errorMessageText\": null\n}\n```\n\n### Checking the status of bookings\n\n#### Checking the status of a single booking:\n\n- [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings) can be used to check the status of a booking after it has been purchased. This is useful for checking the status of a pending booking, particularly if there are multiple items within the booking.\n\n  It is recommended that you poll the service no more than once per hour.\n\n#### Checking the status of multiple bookings:\n\n- [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus) will return the status of all bookings, based on the following:\n  - booking date range\n  - travel date range\n  - specific distributor/distributor item references\n  - lead traveler date/first name\n\nThis is useful for checking the status of recently-made, but still *pending* bookings, or those that will commence soon.\n\n**Note:** You can only poll this service (successful calls) once every 30 minutes.\n\n### Confirming the booking via email\n\nUpon receiving a successful response from [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook), merchant partners should confirm the booking with the customer via email. This email must be sent by the merchant partner (not Viator).\n\n#### Sample confirmation email\n\n&lt;pre&gt;\nDear Traveller,\n\nThank you for booking with [PARTNER NAME] on [www.domain.com]. Your booking is confirmed. This is your booking notification and receipt. Please retain this email for your records.\n\nPlease note:\n\nWe offer three types of vouchers. Be sure to check below for what type of voucher your tour / activity requires. Voucher requirements vary by tour, so if you've booked more than one tour, be sure to check each one.

Determine the `destinationId` for the desired destination using the [/taxonomy/destinations](#operation/taxonomyDestinations) service.\n2. Search for products in the destination with the [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) service using the `destinationId`, along with optional parameters like the date range (`startDate` and `endDate`), attraction link (`seoId`), category (`catId`) and subcategory (`subCatId`).\n\n#### Example [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) POST request body:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"startDate\": \"2018-12-25\",\n  \"endDate\": \"2018-12-28\",\n  \"topX\": \"1-15\", \n  \"destId\": 684, \n  \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n  \"sortOrder\": \"TOP_SELLERS\"\n}\n```\n**Note**: the `startDate` and `endDate` must be in the future.\n\n3. Get the product details with the [/product](#operation/product) service.\n\n#### Example parameters for a [/product](#operation/product) GET request:\n\n```html\ncode=5010SYDNEY&amp;currencyCode=USD\n```\n\n### Determine the product's available dates\n\nUse the [/booking/availability/dates](#operation/bookingAvailabilityDates) service to retrieve a list of dates on which the product is operating. This list can be used to populate a calendar display of available dates.\n\n#### Example parameters for an availability check using the [/booking/availability/dates](#operation/bookingAvailabilityDates) service:\n\n```html\nproductCode=5010SYDNEY\n```\n\n### Determine the available age bands for the product\n\nBecause the product option (tour grade) availability check requires the desired passenger mix, the user will first need to select the number of travelers and the age band into which each can be classified.\n\nNote: The exact ages to which each age band refers to differs between products. See [Working with age bands](#section/Key-concepts/Working-with-age-bands) for more information.\n\n1. Determine the number of passengers/travelers (and their respective agebands) by having the user input the passenger mix for which they wish to make a booking.\n2. Check for available tour grades for the date chosen using the [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) service; or, check for available tour grades by month using the [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgradesPricingmatrix) service\n\n#### [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) POST request:\n```javascript\n{\n  \"productCode\": \"5010SYDNEY\",\n  \"bookingDate\": \"2018-12-05\",\n  \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n  \"ageBands\": [\n    {      \n      \"bandId\": 1,\n      \"count\": 2    \n    }  \n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) POST request:\n```javascript\n{\n  \"productCode\": \"5010SYDNEY\",\n  \"month\": \"12\",\n  \"year\": \"2018\",\n  \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\n}\n```\n3. Finalize pricing using the [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgradesPricingmatrix) service. \n  - **Note**: we strongly recommend using the [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice) service prior to making the booking, as it reconfirms the product availability for the specified dates and passenger mix.\n\n4. Make the booking\n  - Note that the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service supports multi-item bookings. The response from the [/product](#operation/product) service indicates mandatory information that must be sent when making the booking, such as required [booking questions](#section/Appendices/Booking-questions) and hotel pick-up options.\n  - For hotel pick-up:\n    - Send a hotel ID to the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service if `hotelPickup` is `true` for the product.\n    - [/booking/hotels](#operation/bookingHotels) can be used to return a list of hotels available for the product.\n    - The `hotelId` is the `id` field in the response from the [/booking/hotels](#operation/bookingHotels) service. This can be:\n      -  a number (represented as a string) – e.g., `'4119'`\n      -  `'local'` – if the customer resides near the location in which the product operates \n      -  `'notBooked'` – if the customer's hotel is not yet booked\n      -  `'notListed'` – if the customer's hotel is not listed in the response from [/booking/hotels](#operation/bookingHotels). If this is the case, capture the customer’s hotel details in a text box and pass this information in the `pickupPoint` field in the request body of the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service.\n\n#### [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) POST request example:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"demo\": true,\n  \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n  \"partnerDetail\": {\n      \"distributorRef\": \"distributorRef1550616101308\"\n  },\n  \"booker\": {\n      \"firstname\": \"Homer Test\",\n      \"surname\": \"Simpson Test\",\n      \"title\": \"Mr\",\n      \"email\": \"apitest@viator.com\",\n      \"homePhone\": \"(02)66987564\"\n  },\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"partnerItemDetail\": {\n        \"distributorItemRef\": \"distributorItemRef1550616101308\"\n      },\n      \"hotelId\": null,\n      \"pickupPoint\": null,\n      \"travelDate\": \"2019-03-19\",\n      \"productCode\": \"5010SYDNEY\",\n      \"tourGradeCode\": \"24HOUR\",\n      \"languageOptionCode\": \"en/SERVICE_GUIDE\",\n      \"bookingQuestionAnswers\": [\n        {\n          \"questionId\": 100,\n          \"answer\": \"120 kgs\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"specialRequirements\": \"\",\n      \"travellers\": [\n        {\n          \"bandId\":1,\n          \"firstname\": \"Homer\",\n          \"surname\": \"Simpson Test\",\n          \"title\": \"Mr\",\n          \"leadTraveller\": true\n        }, {\n          \"bandId\": 1,\n          \"firstname\": \"Marge\",\n          \"surname\": \"Merchant Viator Test\",\n          \"title\": \"Mrs\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### [/booking/hotels](#operation/bookingHotels) GET example parameters:\n\n```html\nproductCode=5010SYDNEY\n```\nor\n```html\ndestId=684\n```\n\n5. You will receive different booking statuses depending on the product's booking engine. \n  - For products that are free-sale (`'FreesaleBE'`), unconditional free-sale (`'UnconditionalBE'`) and free-sale / on-request (`'FreesaleOnRequestBE'`) - i.e., during the free-sale period, confirmation should occur instantly. \n  - The `'FreesaleOnRequestBE'` status means that the product will only remain free-sale up until a certain number of days before the travel date, after which it becomes on-request. \n  - Normally, if the product is on-request, its booking status will be `'Pending'`.\n\n### Post-booking\n\n#### Displaying vouchers\n\nTo display the voucher to your customer, direct them to the URL returned in the `voucherURL` field in the response from the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service.\n\n**Note**: the voucher will not be available until the booking is confirmed – the value of the `hoursConfirmed` field in the response from the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service can be shown to the customer to indicate the time frame within which they are likely to be notified as to their booking confirmation.\n\n#### Viewing bookings\n\n- To view a **single** booking, use the [/booking/pastbooking](#operation/bookingPastbooking) service, which returns one booking at a time. \n- To retrieve **all** bookings for a customer, use the [/booking/mybookings](#operation/bookingMybookings) service.\n\n#### Viewing booking statuses\n\nTo view the booking statuses for multiple items based on various criteria, use the [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus) service.\n\nNote that this service can only be polled once every five minutes. Ideally, this service should be used by your software implementation to perform bulk updates of pending itineraries. The maximum number of itinerary results returned is 1,000.\n\n#### `merchantNetPrice` and `price` in the [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) service\n\nThe difference between these fields is as follows:\n\n- `merchantNetPrice` is the amount you, as the merchant partner will be invoiced for, excluding any fees.\n- `price` is the price at which Viator sells the product\n\n**Note**: these prices are also returned (per age band) by the following services:\n\n- [/booking/availability/tourgrades/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgradesPricingmatrix)\n- [/booking/pricingmatrix](#operation/bookingPricingmatrix)\n- [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook)\n\n### Currency considerations for bookings\n\nIf the booking shows prices converted to and formatted according to a different currency to that in which it was made, it is because each API partner has a particular 'base currency', and all bookings will be made in that currency.\n\n### Booking and transaction fees\n\nThe total price may be different to the `merchantNetPrice` due to the fact that a booking fee – i.e., a transaction fee or commission – is added to all bookings.\n\nThis fee is a fixed percentage with a capped maximum. The exact percentage depends on your merchant partner agreement with Viator and can be found in your contract with Viator.\n\n### Making demo bookings\n\nTo make a demo booking, simply set the `demo` field to `true` in the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service.\n\nWhile demo bookings are allowed on the live production environment, we recommend not doing so as it is possible that a notification could be sent to the supplier. Performing a cancellation of the demo booking is therefore recommended.\n\nTo cancel the booking, partners should use the [/bookings/{id}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking) service. For details on canceling a booking, see: [Cancellation API workflow](#section/Common-workflows-and-data-validation/Cancellation-API-workflow)\n\n## Cancellation UX\n\nOn the Viator.com website, once the customer has made a booking, they are able to access the details of all their upcoming, past and cancelled bookings by navigating to the **bookings** section of the website.\n\nYou must communicate to the user the terms and conditions that pertain to canceling their booking; i.e., what to expect in terms of the refund they will receive if they were to cancel their booking now.\n\nOn the Viator website, this information is communicated in the cancellation button text. In the following example, the user has booked the \"San Francisco City Tour with Alcatraz\", and is viewing their **bookings** page.\n\nIn this way, the user is told that they can \"cancel for free by Oct 22\" – i.e., they will be issued a full refund if they cancel the product prior to October 22:\n\n![user bookings](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/user-bookings.png)\n\nThis text is programmatically generated by inspecting the product's cancellation policy, which is contained within the `merchantTermsAndConditions` object, which is included in the response object from the following endpoints:\n\n- [/booking/book](/partner-api/merchant/technical/#operation/bookingBook)\n- [/booking/pastbooking](/partner-api/merchant/technical/#operation/bookingPastbooking)\n- [/booking/mybookings](/partner-api/merchant/technical/#operation/bookingMybookings)\n\nFor details on how to interpret the `merchantTermsAndConditions` object, see: [Cancellation policy](#section/Key-concepts/Cancellation-policy)\n\nOnce the user clicks the button labelled: **Cancel for free by Oct 22**, they are brought to the cancellation confirmation page, where they are provided a more formal cancellation quote prior to confirming their intention to cancel the product.\n\n### Cancellation refund display\n\nAs the merchant of record, the amount your customer was charged for the product was your decision; therefore, the amount that you elect to grant the customer as a refund is also up to you, so you will need to retrieve the amount the customer has paid for the product from your own records/databases.\n\nThe amount that Viator would have invoiced you for the booking – equivalent to the merchant net price at the time of booking plus the transaction fee – can be retrieved using the [/bookings/{booking-ref}/cancel-quote](#operation/cancelBookingQuote) endpoint. For more information see: [Get a cancellation quote](#get-a-cancellation-quote)\n\nHere, the customer is shown that they will receive a full refund if they cancel the product now:\n\n![cancellation quote](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/cancellation-quote.png)\n\n### Displaying and choosing cancellation reasons\n\nAt this point in the workflow, the user must select a reason for their cancellation. Viator's systems require that a reason for the cancellation be given in order to carry out the cancellation process.\n\nAs the set of acceptable reasons for canceling a booking are formally specified by the Viator Partner API and are not necessarily immutable (new reasons may be added at any time) you should retrieve the presently available cancellation reasons from the [/bookings/cancel-reasons](#operation/cancellationReasons) endpoint. We require you to present these to the customer for them to select.\n\nUse the `cancellationReasonText` fields in the response to populate the list from which the customer can select the most-appropriate match for why they are canceling, as on the Viator website:\n\n![user bookings](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/cancellation-reasons.png)\n\nFor more information about getting cancellation reasons, see: [Getting cancellation reasons](#getting-cancellation-reasons)\n\n**Note**: As it is necessary for the user to provide a cancellation reason, it is required that the **Cancel Booking** button remain disabled until a reason has been selected by the customer.\n\n### Completing the cancellation\n\nOnce the user has selected a reason, the **Cancel Booking** button can be activated:\n\n![cancel booking](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/cancel-booking.png)\n\nClicking the **Cancel Booking** button is the final action required of the customer to complete the cancellation.\n\nAt this point, you will want to cancel the booking using the [/bookings/{booking-ref}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking) API endpoint. For more information on using this service, see: [Cancel the booking](#cancel-the-booking)\n\n### Obtaining confirmation for the cancellation\n\nOn the Viator.com site, the following confirmation message is displayed on the page that loads after the **Cancel Booking** button is clicked:\n\n![cancellation confirmation](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/cancellation-confirmation.png)\n\n### Cancellation confirmation email\n\nOnce the cancellation is accepted, a short, succinct email informing the customer that their booking has been successfully canceled is sent immediately:\n\n![cancellation confirmation email](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/cancellation-email.png)\n\n### Viewing canceled bookings\n\nClicking on the **View reservation details** button in the cancellation confirmation email returns the customer to their bookings page, where the fact of the booking being canceled is communicated clearly:\n\n![canceled booking](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/canceled-booking.png)\n\n## Cancellation API workflow\n\n### Note:\n\n- All booking cancellations (except for those requested after the date of travel) must now be performed via the API. Viator no longer offers ordinary cancellation services via our customer support function.\n- To cancel a booking after the tour or activity has occurred, please contact [Viator Partner Support](mailto:dpsupport@viator.com)\n- **Legacy API keys:** Bookings made via the [v1 /booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) endpoint using a [v1 legacy API key](#section/Authentication/Legacy-API-keys) can be canceled using the [v2 cancellation endpoint](#operation/cancelBooking) and a [v2 API key](#section/Authentication/API-key) so long as the [legacy (v1) API key](#section/Authentication/Legacy-API-keys) used to make the booking is linked to the partner's [v2 API key](#section/Authentication/API-key).\n\n\n### Getting cancellation reasons\n&lt;a id=\"getting-cancellation-reasons\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhen canceling a booking, you are required to submit a valid 'reason for the cancellation' to assist with Viator's internal processes. This is accomplished via the inclusion of a valid reason code in the body of the request. The reason codes can be retrieved from the [/bookings/cancel-reasons](#operation/cancellationReasons) endpoint.\n\nAs the acceptable reasons for cancellation may be extended at any point (existing reasons will not change or be removed), we recommend retrieving an up-to-date list from this endpoint at least weekly.\n\nThe output from the [/bookings/cancel-reasons](#operation/cancellationReasons) endpoint at the time of writing is as follows:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"reasons\": [\n        {\n            \"cancellationReasonCode\": \"Customer_Service.I_canceled_my_entire_trip\",\n            \"cancellationReasonText\": \"I canceled my entire trip\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"cancellationReasonCode\": \"Customer_Service.Booked_wrong_tour_date\",\n            \"cancellationReasonText\": \"Booked wrong tour/date\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"cancellationReasonCode\": \"Customer_Service.Duplicate_Booking\",\n            \"cancellationReasonText\": \"Duplicate Booking\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"cancellationReasonCode\": \"Customer_Service.Chose_a_different_cheaper_tour\",\n            \"cancellationReasonText\": \"Chose a different/cheaper tour\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"cancellationReasonCode\": \"Customer_Service.Weather\",\n            \"cancellationReasonText\": \"Weather\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"cancellationReasonCode\": \"Customer_Service.Unexpected_medical_circumstances\",\n            \"cancellationReasonText\": \"Unexpected/medical circumstances\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"cancellationReasonCode\": \"Customer_Service.Tour operator asked me to cancel\",\n            \"cancellationReasonText\": \"Tour operator asked me to cancel\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Canceling a booking\n\n#### Getting a cancellation quote\n&lt;a id=\"get-a-booking-cancellation-quote\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBefore canceling the booking, call the [/bookings/{booking-reference}/cancel-quote](#operation/cancelBookingQuote) endpoint to get information about whether the booking can be canceled using this endpoint and what the refund will be, for example:\n\n```html\nGET https://api.viator.com/partner/bookings/BR-580254558/cancel-quote\n```\n\n**Note**: For information about the **{booking-reference}** in URL parameter, see [Key concepts: Booking references](#section/Key-concepts/Booking-references)\n\nYou will receive a cancellation quote object, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"bookingId\": \"BR-580254558\",\n    \"status\": \"CANCELLABLE\",\n    \"refundDetails\": {\n        \"itemPrice\": 109.77,\n        \"refundAmount\": 109.77,\n        \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n        \"refundPercentage\": 100.00\n    }\n}\n```\n\n **Note**: Bookings that have not been confirmed by the supplier and have a status of `\"PENDING\"` will report an `itemPrice`, `refundAmount` and `refundPercentage` of `0`, as no fees are charged until the booking's status is `\"CONFIRMED\"`.\n\nThe data elements in this object have meanings as follows:\n\n| Element | Meaning | Example |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| `bookingId` | the booking reference number prepended with `BR-` | `BR-580254556` |\n| `status` | One of the following: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;`CANCELLABLE`: the booking is eligible to be cancelled&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`CANCELLED`: the booking has already been cancelled&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`NOT_CANCELLABLE`: the booking is for a product that operated in the past, and therefore cannot be cancelled using this endpoint (you will need to [send an email to dpsupport](mailto:dpsupport@viator.com) including both \"CANCEL\" and the booking reference number in the subject line in order to request a refund for such a booking)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | `CANCELLABLE` |\n| `refundDetails` | object containing information about the refund | |\n| `itemPrice` | the **merchant net price** + **transaction fee** for this product at the time of booking in the currency specified by `currencyCode` | `109.77` |\n| `refundAmount` | the amount that will be deducted from your invoice if the booking is cancelled now | `109.77` |\n| `currencyCode` | the currency code for the currency in which pricing information is displayed | `USD` |\n| `refundPercentage` | the refund amount expressed as a percentage of the `itemPrice` | `100.00` |\n\n#### Canceling the booking\n&lt;a id=\"cancel-the-booking\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf the `status` field has a value of `CANCELLABLE` and you are happy with the `refundAmount`, call the [/bookings/{booking-ref}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking) endpoint to cancel the booking, e.g.:\n\n```html\nPOST https://api.viator.com/partner/bookings/BR-580254558/cancel\n```\n\nA reason code corresponding to the reason for cancellation must be included in the request body; e.g.:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"reasonCode\":\"Customer_Service.Chose_a_different_cheaper_tour\"\n}\n```\n\nYou should receive a response indicating that the cancellation was successful, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"bookingId\": \"BR-580254558\",\n    \"status\": \"ACCEPTED\"\n}\n```\n\nA `status` of `ACCEPTED` indicates that the booking was successfully canceled.\n\n## Calculating prices\n\nThe [/booking/calculateprice](#operation/bookingCalculateprice) service is used to calculate a total price for one or more products, with the ability to specify the date and passenger mix for each product individually. \n\nIt also reconfirms the availability and pricing of the products for the requested dates and passenger mixes. We strongly recommended that you call this service prior to [making a booking](#section/Common-workflows-and-data-validation/Making-a-booking) to establish that the booking will succeed once submitted.\n\nThis endpoint is useful when implementing a shopping cart, as multiple product bookings can be enquired about in a single call to this service.\n\n#### Example request body (JSON)\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n  \"items\": [{\n    \"travelDate\": \"2015-03-01\",\n    \"productCode\": \"2916ROME\",\n    \"tourGradeCode\":\"24HR\",\n    \"travellers\": [\n      {\n        \"bandId\": 1\n      },\n      {\n        \"bandId\": 1\n      }\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n```\nThe quirky `travellers` array is used to specify the number of travellers in each age band. Each member object of this array corresponds to a single traveller. The example above signifies \"two adults from bandId: 1\".\n\nAnother example might be \"three travelers from bandId:1 and two travelers from bandId:2\". That would be as follows:\n\n```javascript\n\"travellers\": [\n  {\n    \"bandId\": 1\n  },\n  {\n    \"bandId\": 1\n  },\n  {\n    \"bandId\": 1\n  },\n  {\n    \"bandId\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"bandId\": 2\n  }\n]\n```\n\n- **Note**: See [Working with age bands](#section/Key-concepts/Working-with-age-bands) for more information.\n\n#### Price information\n\nThe **total price** (i.e., including the transaction fee) that you will be invoiced for the products to be booked is given in the following fields in the response from this service:\n\n- `data.itemSummaries[].price` (numeric total price of item)\n- `data.itemSummaries[].priceFormatted` (currency formatted total price of item) \n- `data.itinerary.totalPrice` (numeric total price of item)\n- `data.itinerary.totalPriceFormatted` (currency-formatted total price of item)\n\nFor more information about pricing fields and their meaning throughout this API, see: [Merchant pricing](#section/Key-concepts/Merchant-pricing).\n\n#### Determining whether the product is 'freesale' or 'on request'\n\nYou can determine whether the booking is *freesale* or *on-request* by examining the response from this endpoint. 'Freesale' bookings are those that are confirmed immediately (with a status of `\"CONFIRMED\"`) when booked, while *on-request* bookings are instead confirmed by the supplier at a later time. \n\nThe approximate time window for confirmation is provided in the `hoursConfirmed` (integer) field. This can be presented to the customer. \n\n- An `hoursConfirmed` of `0` means that the booking is *freesale*. \n- An `hoursConfirmed` greater than `0` indicates that the booking is *on-request*.\n\n## Finding hotel pick-up points\n\n### Hotel pickup example:\n\n#### Example response body ([/booking/hotels](#operation/bookingHotels))\n```javascript\n{\n  \"vmid\":\"221002\",\n  \"errorMessage\": null,\n  \"errorType\": null,\n  \"dateStamp\": \"2012-04-12T13:48:27+0000\",\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"errorReference\": null,\n  \"errorMessageText\": null,\n  \"totalCount\": 1,\n  \"errorName\": null\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"address\": null,\n      \"name\": \"I live locally / I'm staying with friends, relatives\",\n      \"id\": \"local\",\n      \"phone\": null,\n      \"productCodes\": null,\n      \"destinationId\": 0,\n      \"city\": null,\n      \"notes\": null,\n      \"latitude\": null,\n      \"longitude\": null,\n      \"postcode\": null,\n      \"brand\": null,\n      \"hotelString\": \"I live locally / I'm staying with friends, relatives\",\n      \"sortOrder\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"address\": null,\n      \"name\": \"My hotel is not yet booked\",\n      \"id\": \"notBooked\",\n      \"phone\": null,\n      \"productCodes\": null,\n      \"destinationId\": 0,\n      \"city\": null,\n      \"notes\": null,\n      \"latitude\": null,\n      \"longitude\": null,\n      \"postcode\": null,\n      \"brand\": null,\n      \"hotelString\": \"My hotel is not yet booked\",\n      \"sortOrder\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"address\": null,\n      \"name\": \"My hotel is not listed\",\n      \"id\": \"notListed\",\n      \"phone\": null,\n      \"productCodes\": null,\n      \"destinationId\": 0,\n      \"city\": null,\n      \"notes\": null,\n      \"latitude\": null,\n      \"longitude\": null,\n      \"postcode\": null,\n      \"brand\": null,\n      \"hotelString\": \"My hotel is not listed\",\n      \"sortOrder\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"address\": \"375 East Harmon Avenue\",\n      \"name\": \"Alexis Park Resort Hotel\",\n      \"id\": \"684_2\",\n      \"phone\": \"\",\n      \"productCodes\": null,\n      \"destinationId\": 684,\n      \"city\": \"Las Vegas\",\n      \"notes\": null,\n      \"latitude\": 36.106258,\n      \"longitude\": -115.156146,\n      \"postcode\": \"89169\",\n      \"brand\": \"\",\n      \"hotelString\": null,\n      \"sortOrder\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"address\": \"167 East Tropicana Avenue\",\n      \"name\": \"Americas Best Value Inn\",\n      \"id\": \"684_3\",\n      \"phone\": \"\",\n      \"productCodes\": null,\n      \"destinationId\": 684,\n      \"city\": \"Las Vegas\",\n      \"notes\": null,\n      \"latitude\": 36.100778,\n      \"longitude\": -115.165522,\n      \"postcode\": \"89109\",\n      \"brand\": \"\",\n      \"hotelString\": null,\n      \"sortOrder\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"address\": \"3131 Las Vegas Boulevard South\",\n      \"name\": \"Wynn Resort\",\n      \"id\": \"684_126\",\n      \"phone\": \"\",\n      \"productCodes\": null,\n      \"destinationId\": 684,\n      \"city\": \"Las Vegas\",\n      \"notes\": null,\n      \"latitude\": 36.127563,\n      \"longitude\": -115.167704,\n      \"postcode\": \"89109\",\n      \"brand\": \"\",\n      \"hotelString\": null,\n      \"sortOrder\": 119\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n## Making a booking\n\nTo make a booking, use the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service.\n\nTo make a *real* booking, ensure `demo` is set to `false` in the booking request.\n\nDemo bookings will enter our system as a test booking and will not charge the merchant. To enable demo bookings, set `demo` to `true` in the booking request and pass `\"test\"` as the traveler's first or last name.\n\n**Note:** Avoid testing on **Live**, as the booking may be sent to the supplier (depending on the product). Any test bookings on live must be cancelled via the [/bookings/{id}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking) service; or, contact dpsupport@viator.com if you experience any other issues.\n\n### distrbutorRef and distributorItemRef\n\nThe `distributorRef` and `distrbutorItemRef` fields are the merchant partner's own reference for the booking. All merchant partners must pass a `distributorRef` and a `distributorItemRef` in all bookings.\n\nIt can be any alphanumeric string, and in for the `distrbutorRef`, it must be unique to bookings made by the merchant.\n\nIf an existing `distributorRef` is passed, the booking with the matching `distributorRef` will be returned in the response, and a new booking will not be made.\n\nPlease see the description for these fields in the table below for more information.\n\n**Example request**\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"demo\": true,\n  \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n  \"partnerDetail\": {\n    \"distributorRef\": \"distroRef0412141435\"\n  },\n  \"booker\": {\n    \"email\": \"apitest@viator.com\",\n    \"firstname\": \"Homer Test\",\n    \"surname\": \"Simpson Test\",\n    \"title\": \"Mr\"\n  },\n  \"items\": [{\n    \"partnerItemDetail\": {\n      \"distributorItemRef\": \"distroItemRef0412141435_1\"\n    },\n    \"hotelId\": null,\n    \"pickupPoint\": null,\n    \"travelDate\": \"2015-03-31\",\n    \"productCode\": \"2916ROME\",\n    \"tourGradeCode\": \"24HR\",\n    \"languageOptionCode\": \"en/SERVICE_GUIDE\",\n    \"bookingQuestionAnswers\": [{\n      \"questionId\": 100,\n      \"answer\": \"120 kgs\"\n    }],\n    \"specialRequirements\": \"\",\n    \"travellers\": [{\n      \"bandId\": 1,\n      \"firstname\": \"Homer\",\n      \"surname\": \"Simpson Test\",\n      \"title\": \"Mr\",\n      \"leadTraveller\": true\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n**Description of JSON request parameters**\n\n| Object name | Element name | Type | Comments | Mandatory |\n|-------------|--------------|:----:|----------|:---------:|\n|        | `demo`      | boolean | If this is set to True, then it is a demo booking only.

This can be either the new method (the `exp-api-key` &lt;u&gt;header&lt;/u&gt; parameter) or, the legacy method (the `apiKey` &lt;u&gt;query&lt;/u&gt; parameter).\n\nWhile both methods remain available, we strongly recommend that you use the new method, as it:\n\n1. Provides access to all languages available for your organization with a single API-key as opposed to one API-key per language\n2. Allows access to the new [booking cancellation endpoints](#section/Common-workflows-and-data-validation/Cancellation-API-workflow), as well as all newly-created endpoints in future\n \nPlease speak to your account manager if you are still using the legacy apiKey and would like to switch to our new authentication mechanism.\n\n#### How to set up the new exp-api-key header parameter\n\n1. Select **Edit** from the collection menu:\n\n![postman-testing-1](/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/postman-testing-1.png)\n\n2. Set the following values:\n\n* **Key**: `exp-api-key`\n* **Value**: Your organization's single exp-api-key, which will have an identical format to that shown in the image below\n* **Add to**: Header\n\n![postman-testing-2](/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/postman-testing-2.png)\n\n3. Click **Update**\n\n#### How to set up the legacy apiKey query parameter\n\n1. Select **Edit** from the collection menu:\n\n![postman-testing-1](/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/postman-testing-1.png)\n\n2. Set the following values:\n\n* **Key**: `apiKey`\n* **Value**: One of your organization's legacy apiKeys, which will have an identical format to that shown in the image below\n* **Add to**: Query Params\n\n![postman-testing-3](/partner-api/resources/merchant/technical/img/postman-testing-2.png)\n\n3. Click **Update**\n\n# FAQs\n\n**Is a confirmation email sent to the customer or supplier when a booking is made in the sandbox environment?**\n\n* No.\n\n**How do I make a demo booking?**\n\n* To make a demo booking, make sure you set `demo` to `true` in your request to the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service.\n\n**What should I do if I successfully create a test booking in the Live environment?**\n\n* Firstly, please don't make test bookings in the Live environment, as doing so may cause a confirmation email to be sent to the product supplier. Nonetheless, if you have made a test booking, cancel it using the [/bookings/{id}/cancel](#operation/cancelBooking) service; or, send an email to dpsupport@viator.com and include both \"CANCEL\" and the booking reference number in the subject line.\n\n**Which currencies can I use when making a booking?**\n\n* You can make a booking using the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) endpoint using any of the [supported currencies](#section/Appendices/Supported-currency-codes).\n* If you attempt to use a non-supported currency, you will receive an error message similar to the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"errorReference\": \"3D45567E:2D4A_0A5D033A:01BB_5F616D10_1FBBC9:7035\",\n  \"data\": null,\n  \"dateStamp\": \"2020-09-15T18:41:00+0000\",\n  \"errorType\": \"EXCEPTION\",\n  \"errorCodes\": [\n    \"UNKNOWN_ERROR\"\n  ],\n  \"errorMessage\": [\n    \"Merchant API does not allow the specified currency\"\n  ],\n  \"errorName\": \"RuntimeException\",\n  \"extraInfo\": {},\n  \"extraObject\": null,\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"totalCount\": 1,\n  \"errorMessageText\": [\n    \"Merchant API does not allow the specified currency\"\n  ],\n  \"vmid\": \"331001\"\n}\n```\n\n**Why am I having an SSL handshake issue?**\n\n* It may be that your SSL certificates have expired. Check this. Also, if you are using Java, make sure that it's [updated to the latest version](https://www.java.com/en/download/).\n\n**What is the difference between `merchantNetPrice` and `price` in the response from the [/search/products](#operation/searchProducts) service?**\n\n* `merchantNetPrice` is the amount you, as the merchant partner, will be invoiced for, excluding any fees.\n* `price` is the price at which Viator sells the product\n\n**Why is a different price displayed in [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) and [/product](#operation/product)**\n\n* [/product](#operation/product) displays the lowest possible price per traveller; whereas, [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) shows the per-traveller price based on the age-band and number of travellers within that age-band.\n\n**A destination is missing its latitude, longitude or time zone**\n\n* Some destinations in the **sandbox** environment may be missing geolocation or time zone data. However, if you encounter a destination in the **Live** environment with missing information, this can be regarded as an unintended omission – please contact us so that we can update our destination information.\n\n**How do I make a test booking?**\n\nTo make a test booking, make sure you:\n\n- set `firstname` and/or `surname` in the `booker` object to `'test'`.\n- set `demo` to `true`\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"demo\": true,\n  \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n  \"partnerDetail\": {\n    \"distributorRef\": \"distroRef0412141435\"\n  },\n  \"booker\": {\n    \"email\": \"apitest@viator.com\",\n    \"firstname\": \"Test\",\n    \"surname\": \"Test\",\n    \"title\": \"Mr\"\n  },\n  \"items\": [{\n    \"partnerItemDetail\": {\n      \"distributorItemRef\": \"distroItemRef0412141435_1\"\n    },\n    \"hotelId\": null,\n    \"pickupPoint\": null,\n    \"travelDate\": \"2015-03-31\",\n    \"productCode\": \"2916ROME\",\n    \"tourGradeCode\": \"24HR\",\n    \"languageOptionCode\": \"en/SERVICE_GUIDE\",\n    \"bookingQuestionAnswers\": [{\n      \"questionId\": 100,\n      \"answer\": \"120 kgs\"\n    }],\n    \"specialRequirements\": \"\",\n    \"travellers\": [{\n      \"bandId\": 1,\n      \"firstname\": \"Homer\",\n      \"surname\": \"Simpson Test\",\n      \"title\": \"Mr\",\n      \"leadTraveller\": true\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n**Is it possible to use a custom value for `distributorRef` and `distributorItemRef`**\n\n* Yes! In fact, this is what you're supposed to do. You can pass anything you like in these fields; however, if you use a `distributorRef` that has already been used, the API will return the previous booking made with that `distributorRef` rather than creating a new booking.\n* **Note**: `distributorRef` must be fewer than 40 characters\n\n**What are some common reasons for bookings to fail in the Viator API?**\n\n- `homePhone` or any phone field in the booking request contains spaces. The only acceptable non-numeric characters are: “-“,  “+” , “(“,  and “)”\n\n- `distributorRef` has been re-used.  When making a booking request, a `distributorRef` and `distributorItemRef` must be provided. This is the partner’s ID for the booking, and it must be unique. If a `distributorRef` has been re-used, a booking will not be made and instead, the existing booking will be returned in the response.\n\n- `distributorRef` exceeds 40 characters\n\n- No traveller or an incorrect traveller has been set as the lead traveller in the booking request;\n  + `leadTraveller`:`true` must be set for one traveller\n  + the `leadTraveller` must be from an `ageBand` that has `treatAsAdult` set to `true`. The data is available in the `ageBands` object in the product details service.\n\n- `languageOptionCode` is invalid\n  + To find the valid language option codes for a particular product, have a look at the `langServices` object in the response from the [/product](#operation/product) service; e.g.,\n\n```javascript\n\"langServices\": {\n  \"en/SERVICE_AUDIO\": \"English - Audio\"\n}\n```\n  + You must then ensure that the `languageOptionCode` in the request to the [/booking/book](#operation/bookingBook) service is populated in the same way; i.e.,\n\n```javascript\n\"languageOptionCode\": \"en/SERVICE_AUDIO\"\n```\n\n**What does it mean if I receive a \"Section level access denied\" error message?**\n\n- This means that your API-key does not have the correct permissions to access the particular service you were attempting to access when you received this error message. If you feel you would like to use this service nonetheless in your implementation, please contact your account manager to discuss having access granted.\n\n**What does it mean if I receive a \"503 Service Unavailable\" response?**\n\n- This means that there was a temporary service outage on our end at that time. We recommend that you re-try the operation until you no longer receive this error.\n\n**Does API rate limiting apply to all services?**\n\n- Yes, it does. Regardless of the service you are making requests to, the fundamental rate limits apply equally.\n\n**Can I cancel multiple bookings or items at the same time using the Viator API?**\n\n- No, you may only cancel one booking at a time.\n\n**How many concurrent requests can be made of the API from the same IP address?**\n\n- Three.\n\n**Will my API-key expire?**\n\n- If any API-key is not used for a period of six months, that key is automatically deactivated as a security measure. If this has happened to you, contact your account manager to have the key reactivated or a new key issued to you.\n\n**Why am I getting an empty response when checking booking details?**\n\n- If you are attempting to check a booking using the [/booking/status](#operation/bookingStatus) or [/booking/status/items](#operation/bookingStatusItems) endpoints and receive an empty response, it may be that the booking was made with the demo parameter set to `true`, as the booking status endpoints will ignore demo bookings. Please try making the booking again, ensuring the demo parameter is set to `false`. If this also fails, please email dpsupport@viator.com and include a copy of the request and response JSON objects.\n\n**Must I always provide details for all travelers when booking a product where `allTravellerNamesRequired`=`true`?**\n\n- Approximately 45% of the products in our catalog require all traveller details to be supplied at the time of booking, and this requirement is enforced by the API. While it is technically possible to bypass this requirement – for example, by setting the lead traveler's name, but using dummy values for the the remaining travelers' details ('traveler 2', etc.) – we strongly advise against this, as it can cause problems for suppliers for whom this is a strict requirement. Examples include: Alcatraz tickets, theme park tickets that require a QR code, bookings for flights needing to meet TSA requirements; or, vehicle, Segway or jet-ski rentals. If you are unable to implement the collection of all traveler details on your site, we recommend filtering-out products where this is a strict requirement. You may also request that we filter-out these products for you so that they do not appear in product search results.\n\n**Must I always provide answers to the required booking questions when making a booking?**\n\n- Yes. You must provide answers to all necessary booking questions when making a booking. Approximately 40% of the products in our catalog have booking questions, some of which may be necessary to fulfil the suplier's legal requirements. In the case that the customer cannot provide specific details at the time of booking – e.g., a departure flight number – they may enter 'unknown' and the supplier will manually send a follow-up message to ask for this information.\n\n**Why is there such a big difference in price between that given in the product endpoints and the actual price at the time of booking?**\n\n- The price returned in the product endpoints is the 'From Price', which is the &lt;u&gt;lowest possible price&lt;/u&gt; for an adult passenger when taking into account all available tour grades, group bookings and so forth. The exact price can only be determined when you check the availability for a specific date and passenger/traveler mix. We recommend using the [/booking/availability/tourgrades](#operation/bookingAvailabilityTourgrades) endpoint for this purpose.\n\n**Why doesn't the [/taxonomy/destinations](#operation/taxonomyDestinations) endpoint return continent-level information?**\n\n- Products are categorized according to their 'destination', which includes cities, regions and countries. The next logical grouping would be 'by continent'; however, this would be too broad a grouping, resulting in too many search results and lengthy response times if the product catalogue were to be searched by continent. For more information, see: [Categorization of content](#section/Key-concepts/Categorization-of-content)\n\n**Will there ever be a discrepancy between the amount charged for a tour and the amount refunded due to currency exchange-rate fluctuations?**\n\n- In short: no. Firstly, the cost of the booking and the refund amount are always calculated in the product supplier's native currency – no exchange rate calculations are applied. I.e., if the cost of the booking was USD 100 and the refund percentage is 100% (full refund, as per the response from [/bookings/{booking-reference}/cancel-quote](#operation/cancelBookingQuote)), Viator will simply not invoice you for that USD 100 that we would have if the booking was not canceled. Furthermore, we do not invoice you for the cost of a booking prior to its departure date. \n\n# Appendices\n\n## Update log\n\n| Date | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 20 July 2020 | Added [Booking references](#section/Key-concepts/Booking-references) section |\n| 14 July 2020 | Updated [Calculating prices](#section/Common-workflows-and-data-validation/Calculating-prices) section |\n| 2 June 2020 | Updated Postman collections and [Testing](#section/Testing) section |\n| 18 May 2020 | Added note regarding cancel codes to [Legacy merchant cancellation](#section/Appendices/Legacy-merchant-cancellation) section |\n| 7 May 2020 | Upgraded search feature; enabled 'Try it Out' console |\n| 10 Mar 2020 | Created new [Overview](#section/Overview) section; removed 'Availability services' section, moving section contents into [Key Concepts](#section/Key-concepts) section |\n\n## Accept-Language header\n\nThe `Accept-Language` header parameter controls which language the natural language fields in the response from each endpoint will be translated into.\n\nNote that you can only specify languages that have been configured for your API-key. Therefore, if you wish to access additional languages, you will need to contact your business development account manager.\n\n| Language | Accept-Language parameter value |\n|----------|-------|\n| English | `en`, `en-US` |\n| Danish | `da`, `da-DK` |\n| Dutch | `nl`, `nl-NL` |\n| Norwegian | `no`, `no-NO` |\n| Spanish | `es`, `es-ES` |\n| Swedish | `sv`, `sv-SE` |\n| French | `fr`, `fr-FR` |\n|

`ko`, `ko-KR` |\n\n## Standard JSON fields\n\nEvery service returns a standard set of JSON fields at the end of the JSON response, which indicates if it was processed successfully by the API.\n\nIn addition to the `success` flag, you will also need to check the `errorMessage` values for the status of the response. \n\nAn error-free response will have:\n\n- `\"success\"`:`true`\n- `\"errorType\"`:`null`\n- `\"errorMessage\"`:`null`\n\n### Example JSON - successful:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"data\": [],\n  \"vmid\": \"321001\",\n  \"errorMessage\": null,\n  \"errorType\": null,\n  \"dateStamp\": \"2013-03-06T19:45:10+0000\",\n  \"errorReference\": null,\n  \"errorMessageText\": null,\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"totalCount\": 114,\n  \"errorName\": null\n}\n```\n\n### Example JSON - unsuccessful:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"errorReference\": \"~5793740141815885188840666\",\n  \"data\": null,\n  \"dateStamp\": \"2013-09-09T11:29:48+0000\",\n  \"errorType\": \"EXCEPTION\",\n  \"errorMessage\": [\"* Additional questions missing\\n\"],\n  \"errorName\": \"ValidationException\",\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"totalCount\": 1,\n  \"vmid\": \"221001\",\n  \"errorMessageText\":

    "description": "## Introduction\nThe VisibleThread b API provides services for analyzing/searching documents and web pages.\nTo use the service you need an API key. \n\n**Contact us at support@visiblethread.com to request an API key**. \n\nThe services are split into **Documents** and **Webscans**.\n\n### Documents\nUpload documents and dictionaries so you can :\n- Measure the readability of your document\n- search a document for all terms from a dictionary\n- retrieve all paragraphs from a document or only matching paragraphs\n\n### Webscans\nAnalyze web pages so you can: \n- Measure the readability of your web content\n- Identify & highlight content issues e.g. long sentences, passive voice\n\nThe VisibleThread API allows you to programatially submit webpage urls to be scanned, \ncheck on the results of a scan, and view a list of previous scans you have performed.\n    \n-------------\n\nThe VisibleThread API is a HTTP-based JSON API, accessible at https://api.visiblethread.com \nEach request to the service requires your API key to be successful.\n\n## Getting Started With Webscans\n\nSteps:\n1. Enter your API key above and hit **Explore**. \n2. Run a new scan by submitting a **POST to /webscans** (title and some webUrls are required).\n   The scan runs asynchronously in the background but returns immediately with a JSON response containing an \"id\" that represents your scan.\n3. Check on the status of a scan by submitting **GET /webscans/{scanId}**, if the scan is still in progress it will return a HTTP 503. If \n   it is complete it will return a HTTP 200 with the appropriate JSON outlining the urls scanned and the summary statistics for each url.\n4. Retrieve all your previous scan results by submitting **GET /webscans**.  \n5. Retrieve detailed results for a url within a scan (readability, long sentence and passive language instances) by submitting \n   **GET /webscans/{scanId}/webUrls/{urlId}** (scanId and urlId are required)\n\n## Getting Started With Document scans:\n\nSteps:\n1. Enter your API key above and hit **Explore**\n2. Run a new scan by submitting a **POST to /documents** (document required). The scan runs asynchronously in the background but returns\n   immediately with a JSON response containins an \"id\" that represents your scan\n3. Check on the status of a scan by submitting **GET /documents/{scanId}**, if the scan is still in progress it will return a HTTP 503. If \n   it is complete it will return a HTTP 200 with the appropriate JSON outlining the document readability results. It will contain detailed\n   analysis of each paragraph in the document\n4. Retrieve all your previous scan results by submitting **GET /documents**\n\n### Searching a document for keywords\n\nThe VisibleThread API allows you to upload a set of keywords or a 'dictionary'. You can then perform a search of a already uploaded document \nusing that dictionary\n\nSteps (Assuming you have uploaded your document using the steps above):\n1. Upload a csv file to use as a keyword dictionary by submitting a **POST to /dictionaries** (csv file required). This returns a JSON \n   response with the dictionary Id \n2. Search a document with the dictionary by submitting a **POST to /searches** (document id and dictionary id required). \n3. Get the resuhlts of the search by submitting  **GET /searches/{docId}/{dictionaryId}\" . This will return JSON response containing \n   detailed results of searching the document using the dictionary.\n4. To view the list of all searches you have performed submit a **GET /searches**. \n\nBelow is a list of the available API endpoints, documentation & a form to try out each operation.",

On it you can create your own Entities, store data and consult directly from the storefront or use it to store info for some external integration.\r\n\r\nThere are internal VTEX modules that use VTEX Master Data as data repository. We have the VTEX Customer Service, VTEX Profile System and VTEX InStore, for example. It is also used by other internal services.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to use Master Data:\r\n\r\n1. Directly from the storefront\r\n2. External integration\r\n\r\n### Directly from the storefront\r\n\r\nIf your scenario is to be used inside the storefront, be aware of the following observations:\r\n\r\n1. Use the storefront host to query or store information to avoid **CORS**;\r\n2. Configure which information should be public and which shouldn't, inside the JSON Schema of the Data Entity;\r\n3. Do not create query loops (the storefront may be affected with Throttling and apis may be turned off as a security protection);\r\n4. Never add via JS any type of authentication key (x-vtex-api-appkey or x-vtex-api-apptoken);\r\n\r\n**It's important to avoid CORS using the relative path**\r\n\r\n### External Integration\r\n\r\nIf your scenario is to perform external integration, such as migrating client data from another service, be aware of the following observations:\r\n\r\n1. Use the host ```{{accountName}}.vtexcommercestable.com.br```;\r\n2. Use the authentication keys (x-vtex-api-appkey ou x-vtex-api-apptoken);\r\n\r\n### Most used attributes listed here\r\n\r\n| Name | Description |\r\n| -------- | -------- |\r\n| accountName | Account name in VTEX License Manager |\r\n| name | Data Entity name |\r\n| schema | JSON Schema of a Data Entity |\r\n| id | Identifier of a document |\r\n| x-vtex-api-appKey | User key |\r\n| x-vtex-api-appToken | User token |",

We created this guide to improve the onboarding experience for developers at VTEX. It assembles all documentation on our Developer Portal about Pricing and is organized by focusing on the developer's journey.\r\n\r\nPricing is the VTEX module responsible for the SKU's price list. At this module we have the base price of each SKU, some optional fixed prices by trade policy, and some rules that can be applied to generate dynamically different final prices according to the purchase context and the trade policy. The variables used in this collection are:\r\n\r\n  * **{{accountName}}** = You VTEX account name.\r\n  * **{{tradePolicyId}}** = Current Trade Policy ID.\r\n  * **{{itemId}}** = SKU ID.\r\n  * **{{X-VTEX-API-AppKey}}** and **{{X-VTEX-API-AppToken}}** = Credentials.\r\n\r\nYou can get more information about how to use this module and its business logic at [VTEX Help](http://help.vtex.com).\r\n\r\n## Rate Limits\r\n\r\n### Limits per route\r\n\r\n- `GET`:  routes are not rate limited at the moment\r\n- `PUT or POST`: `40 requests/second/account` in any **price insert/update route** with 1000 *Burst Credits*\r\n- `DELETE`: `16 requests/second/account` in any **price deletion route**, with 300 *Burst Credits*.\r\n\r\n### What are Burst Credits?\r\n\r\nIn case the account exceeds the limit frequency for a  `Rate Limiter` (for instance, when one account makes `41 requests/second` in any `price insert/update route`), we decrease from the *Burst Credit* count the exceeding (in this example, *1 Credit*).\r\n\r\nIn the event of the *Burst Credits* reaching **0 (zero)**, the request is blocked with a `Status 429` response.\r\n\r\nThe credits fill up over time when the route is not being used, in the same rate as the route's `Rate Limiter`. In our example, for each second not sending a **PUT or POST request**, we increase *40 Burst Credits* to this `Rate Limiter`\r\n\r\n### New Response Headers\r\n\r\nIn the response headers of any request to Pricing v2 there are some new headers indicating the current status of the Rate Limiting.\r\nThis information may be useful to evaluate the ideal frequency to send requests to a route, and when to send a new request in the event of reaching a Rate Limit.\r\n\r\n- `Ratelimit-Limit` - Total *Burst Credits* offered to a route\r\n- `Ratelimit-Remaining` - How many *Burst Credits* are still available to use\r\n- `Ratelimit-Reset` - How long (in seconds) it will take to the *Burst Credits* to fill up completely (It will fill up to the `Ratelimit-Limit`)\r\n- `Retry-After` - Indicates how many seconds you will need to wait until the `Rate Limiter` accepts a new request to this route again. If this header response exists, this means your current request has been rate limited and has not been processed.\r\n\r\n### How to integrate with Pricing v2 considering our Rate Limits\r\n\r\nIntegrate considering the limits of **requests/route/account** specified in the [*Limits per route*](#rate-limits) section, avoiding to surpass this frequency.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be Rate Limited, wait the time in seconds specified in `Retry-After` before making another request to the service, and reduce the rate of requests per second that your integration is making.",

    "id": "vtex.local:Pricing-Hub",
    "title": "Pricing Hub",
    "description": "> This feature is in closed beta, available only for selected customers. If you have any questions, contact our [Support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests). \r\n\r\n In the B2B scenario, it is common for stores to have personalized prices per customer and complex pricing systems that require external integrations. Pricing Hub is a system developed for the B2B context that works as an intermediary between VTEX and external pricing systems.\r\n\r\n In VTEX, B2B stores have the option to use our internal pricing system or an external one. If the store chooses to operate with an external pricing system, Pricing Hub will query an external price calculation API. The external API should then respond with the price for all items in the shopping cart according to its predefined tax rules.\r\n\r\n![Pricing hub protocal diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77292838/211634260-e4f7a516-91df-416e-ab43-d9c79d56bc91.png)\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nTo connect with external pricing systems using Pricing Hub, it is necessary to build a VTEX IO middleware app. We offer two reference implementation templates to simplify this process:\r\n\r\n- [C# template](https://github.com/vtex-apps/external-prices-app)\r\n- [Node template](https://github.com/vtex-apps/external-prices-node)\r\n\r\nRead the documentation on each repository to learn more about the required steps to use and customize the app.\r\n\r\n> The app used by Pricing Hub to connect must be a `major 0`. \r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\nSee below all the specifications of the request and the response expected when communicating with Pricing Hub.\r\n\r\n### Price calculation request\r\n\r\nThe external prices calculation tool must provide an endpoint that will receive a `POST` [Get Prices](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-hub#post-/api/pricing-hub/prices) request. This route retrieves and applies prices for the items that are passed in the request. Pricing Hub will select the pricing method that will be used for each item and will fetch their respective price from the selected pricing method.\r\n\r\n>⚠️ Responses from Pricing Hub tend to have a greater delay when compared to other VTEX systems. That is expected, however, due to the complexity of its nested requests. The timeout for this request is 900 milliseconds.\r\n\r\nIn this request, Pricing Hub provides a body in a specific format, exemplified below. This means that either the endpoint must be prepared to receive this body format, or the app must contain a parser to adapt it to the correct format.\r\n\r\n#### Request body example\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"item\": \r\n        {\r\n            \"index\": 0,\r\n            \"skuId\": \"880011\",\r\n            \"quantity\": 1\r\n        },\r\n    \"context\":{\r\n        \"email\": \"john@email.com\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request body should have the following properties:\r\n\r\n| **Attribute** | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |\r\n|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| `item`        | object   | The item whose price is supposed to be fetched by Pricing Hub.                                                                                                                                           |\r\n| ↪ `index`     | integer  | This is the index of the item at Checkout's cart.

To authenticate, you’ll need to supply a sportsbook username and password, in return you will be given an authentication ticket, which you can use on the majority of requests found within our services. <br /><br /><br /> The Sessions API should be used whenever you want to login a customer and:<br /><br /> <ul> <li>continue to use the William Hill API for that customer’s transactions</li> <li>use other CAS-enabled William Hill services outside the suite of APIs</li> </ul> <br /> CAS is an enterprise Single Sign-On solution for web services (see https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CAS/Home). It is used by many William Hill services. <br /> Note: all requests must be executed over HTTPS and include an API key and secret.<br /><br /><br /> <b>Authentication Ticket Expiration Times</b><br /><br /> When a customer is logged in using the Sessions API, they are given an Authentication Ticket; using this ticket on subsequent API requests gives you access to account activities (such as placing a bet, deposits, etc). However, this ticket is only valid for a given period of time depending on how it is used. If the ticket is used and then has a period of inactivity longer than 7,200 seconds (2 hours), then the ticket will expire and further requests using the ticket will be denied - in effect, a customer has been logged out and will need to authenticate again. <br /><br /><br /> Normally, any ticket issued only has a maximum life expectancy of 28,000 seconds (8 hours) after which it can no longer be used, even if it has been used regularly. The customer again will be effectively logged out and will need to authenticate again. If you wish to avoid this, you need to set the query parameter extended to Y, which will enable your application to generate a ticket valid for 60 days without expiring due to inactivity. <br />",

    "title": "Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API Reference Documentation",
    "description": "\n# About the REST API\n\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud<sup>TM</sup> REST API (application programming interface) offers complete programmatic control over live streams, transcoders, stream sources, and stream targets. Anything you can do in the Wowza Streaming Cloud UI can also be achieved by making HTTP-based requests to cloud-based servers through the REST API.\n\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API features *cross-origin resource sharing*, or CORS.\nCORS is a [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) that provides headers in HTTP requests to enable a web server to safely make a network request to another domain.\n\nIn order to protect shared resources, the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API is subject to limits. For details, see [Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API limits](https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-cloud-rest-api-limits).\n# About this documentation\nThis reference documentation is based on the open-source [Swagger framework](http://swagger.io/specification/).\nIt allows you to view the operations, parameters, and request and reponse schemas for every resource. Request samples are presented in cURL (Shell) and JavaScript; some samples also include just the JSON object. Response samples are all JSON.\n\nFor more information and examples on using the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API, see our [library of Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API technical articles](https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-cloud-rest-api).\n\n# Query requirements\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API uses HTTP requests to retrieve data from cloud-based servers. Requests must contain proper JSON, two authentication keys, and the correct version number in the base path.\n\n## JSON\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API uses the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/) to request and return data. This means requests must include the header `Content-Type: application/json` and must include a single resource object in JSON format as primary data.\n\nResponses include HTTP status codes that indicate whether the query was successful. If there was an error, a description explains the problem so that you can fix it and try again.\n\n## Authentication\nRequests to the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API must be authenticated with two keys: an API key and an access key. Each key is a 64-character alphanumeric string that you can find on the **API Access** page in Wowza Streaming Cloud.\n\nUse the `wsc-api-key` and `wsc-access-key` headers to authenticate requests, like this (in cURL):\n\n```bash\ncurl -H 'wsc-api-key: [64-character-api-key-goes-here]' -H 'wsc-access-key: [64-character-access-key-goes-here]'\n```\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Version\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud API is currently at version 1.0.0. Use `v1` in your base path in every request, like this path to the live_streams endpoint:\n```\nhttps://api.cloud.wowza.com/api/v1/live_streams\n```\n## Example query\nHere is a complete example POST request, in cURL, with proper JSON syntax, headers, authentication, and version information:\n```bash\ncurl -H 'wsc-api-key: [64-character-api-key-goes-here]' -H 'wsc-access-key: [64-character-access-key-goes-here]'\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{\n    \"live_stream\": {\n      \"name\": \"My live Stream\",\n      \"...\": \"...\"\n    }\n  }' https://api.cloud.wowza.com/api/v1/live_streams\n```\n",

NLA exposes the same integrations Zapier uses to build our products, to you, to plug-in the capabilties of Zapier's platform into your own products. \n\nFor example, you can use the NLA API to:\n* Send messages in [Slack](https://zapier.com/apps/slack/integrations)\n* Add a row to a [Google Sheet](https://zapier.com/apps/google-sheets/integrations)\n* Draft a new email in [Gmail](https://zapier.com/apps/gmail/integrations)\n* ... and thousands more, with one universal natural language API\n\nThe typical use-case for NLA is to expose our ecosystem of thousands of apps/actions within your own product. NLA is optimized for products that receive user input in natural language (eg. chat, assistant, or other large language model based experience) -- that said, it can also be used to power _any_ product that needs integrations. In this case, think of NLA as a more friendly, human API.\n\nNLA contains a decade of experience with API shenanigans, so you don't have to. Common API complexity, automatically handled:\n* **Every type of auth** (Basic, Session, API Key, OAuth v1, Oauth v2, Digest, ...), Zapier securely handles and signs requests for you\n* **Support for create, update, and search actions**, endpoints optimized for natural language usage\n* **Support for custom fields**, Spreadsheet, CRM, and Mailing List friendly!\n* **Reference by name, not ID**, humans use natural language names, not IDs, to reference things in their apps, so NLA does too\n* **Smart, human defaults**, APIs sometimes have 100 options. Zapier's platform data helps us make NLA simpler for users out of the box\n\n#### Two Usage Modes <a name=\"usage-modes\"></a>\n\nNLA handles all the underlying API auth and translation from natural language --> underlying API call --> return simplified output. The key idea is you (the developer), or your users, expose a set of actions via an oauth-like setup window, which you can then query and execute via a REST API. NLA offers both API Key and OAuth for signing NLA API requests.\n\n1. **Server-side only** (API Key): for quickly getting started, testing, and production scenarios where your app will only use actions exposed in the developer's Zapier account (and will use the developer's connected accounts on Zapier.com)\n\n2. **User-facing** (Oauth): for production scenarios where you are deploying an end-user facing application and your app needs access to end-user's exposed actions and connected accounts on Zapier.com\n\n#### Why Natural Language? \n\nSimply, it makes the API easier to use for both developers and users (and also for [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models)!)\n\nWe designed NLA to expose the power of Zapier's platform without passing along the complexity. A few design choices:\n* There is a [user-facing component](https://cdn.zappy.app/83728f684b91c0afe7d435445fe4ac90.png) to NLA, exposed via a popup window, users set up and enable basic actions which \"expose\" them to you, the `provider`.\n* The default action setup for users is minimal and fast. [All required fields are guessed](https://cdn.zappy.app/20afede9be56bf4e30d31986bc5325f8.png). This guessing is accomplished using an lanuage model on the NLA side.\n* Users can [choose to override any guessed field](https://cdn.zappy.app/e07f6eabfe7512e9decf01cba0c9e847.png) with a fixed value or choice, increasing trust to use the natural language interface.\n* Custom fields (ex. spreadsheet columns) can also be [dynamically guessed at action run time](https://cdn.zappy.app/9061499b4b973200fc345f695b33e3c7.png), or fixed by the user.\n\nUsing the API is then simple:\n\n```\ncurl -v \\\n    -d '{\"instructions\": \"Add Bryan Helmig at Zapier to my NLA test sheet, oh and he loves guitars!\"}' \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>\" \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/<ACTION_ID>/execute/'\n```\n\nOr mix in some fixed values:\n\n```\ncurl -v \\\n    -d '{\"instructions\": \"Send a short poem about automation to slack\", \"channel\": \"#fun-zapier\"}' \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>\" \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/<ACTION_ID>/execute/'\n```\n\n## Auth <a name=\"auth\"></a>\n\n#### For Quickly Exploring <a name=\"exploring\"></a>\n\nIt's best to take advantage of session auth built into the OpenAPI docs.\n\n1. [Log in](/login/zapier/)\n2. [Create and enable an action](/demo/) using our `demo` provider\n\nthen all your enabled (\"exposed\") actions will be available at the bottom of the the **[dynamic API](/api/v1/dynamic/docs)**.\n\n#### For Testing or Production (Server-side only mode) <a name=\"server-side\"></a>\n\nFor development purposes, or using NLA in a server-side only use case, you can get started quickly using the provider `dev`. You can generate an `API key` using this provider and make authenticated requests.\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the [Dev App provider](/dev/provider/debug/) debug page.\n2. Look for \"User\" -> \"Information\" -> \"API Key\". If a key does not exist, follow the instructions to generate one.\n3. Use this key in the header `x-api-key` to make authenticated requests.\n\nTest that the API key is working:\n\n```\ncurl -v \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"x-api-key: <API_KEY>\" \\\n    'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/check/'\n```\n\n#### For Production (User-facing mode) <a name=\"production\"></a>\n\nThe API is authenticated via [standard OAuth v2](https://oauth.net/2/). Submit [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1DWkLQ7SpSZCuZbTxcBB98gck10t) to get access and receive a `cliend_id`, `client_secret`, and your `provider` name (ex. 'acme'). You'll also need to share with us a `redirect_uri` to receive each `code`. This API uses both `access_token` and `refresh_token`.\n\nEach of your users will get a per-user access token which you'll use to sign requests. The access token both authenticates and authorizes a request to access or run (execute) a given user's actions.\n\nThe basic auth flow is:\n\n1. **Send user to our OAuth start URL, ideally in a popup window**\n\n```javascript\nvar url = https://nla.zapier.com/oauth/authorize/?\n    response_type=code&\n    client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&\n    redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>&\n    scope=nla%3Aexposed_actions%3Aexecute\nvar nla = window.open(url, 'nla', 'width=650,height=700');\n```\n\n2. **User approves request for access**\n\n3. **NLA will redirect user via `GET` to the `redirect_uri` you provided us with a `?code=` in the query string**\n\n4. **Snag the `code` and `POST` it to the NLA token endpoint `https://nla.zapier.com/oauth/token/`**\n\n```\ncurl -v \\\n    -d '{ \\\n        \"code\": \"<CODE>\", \\\n        \"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\", \\\n        \"client_id\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>\", \\\n        \"client_secret\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>\" \\\n        }' \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/oauth/token/'\n```\n\n5. **Finally, receive `refresh_token` and `access_token` in response**\n\nSave the refresh token, you'll need to use it to request a new access tokehn when it expires.\n\nNow you can use the `access_token` to make authenticated requests:\n\n```\ncurl -v -H \"Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>\" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json\n```\n\n6. **When the `access_token` expires, refresh it**\n\n```\ncurl -v \\\n    -d '{ \\\n        \"refresh_token\": \"<REFRESH_TOKEN>\", \\\n        \"grant_type\": \"refresh_token\", \\\n        \"client_id\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>\", \\\n        \"client_secret\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>\" \\\n        }' \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/oauth/token/'\n```\n\n## Action Setup Window <a name=\"action-setup-window\"></a>\n\nUsers set up their actions inside a window popup, that looks and feels similar to an OAuth window. The setup URL is the same for all your users: `https://nla.zapier.com/<PROVIDER>/start/`\n\nYou can check the validity of an access/refresh token by checking against the `api/v1/check/` endpoint to determine if you should present the `oauth/authorize/` or `<PROVIDER>/start/` url.\n\nYou'd typically include a button or link somewhere inside your product to open the setup window.\n\n```javascript\nvar nla = window.open('https://nla.zapier.com/<PROVIDER>/start', 'nla', 'width=650,height=700');\n```\n\n_Note: the setup window is optimized for 650px width, 700px height_\n\n## Using the API <a name=\"using-the-api\"></a>\n\n#### Understanding the AI guessing flow <a name=\"ai-guessing\"></a>\n\nNLA is optimized for a chat/assistant style usage paradigm where you want to offload as much work to a large language model, as possible. For end users, the action setup flow that takes ~seconds (compared to minutes/hours with traditional, complex integration setup).\n\nAn action is then run (executed) via an API call with one single natural language parameter `instructions`. In the chat/assistant use case, these instructions are likely being generated by your own large language model. However NLA works just as well even in more traditional software paradigm where `instructions` are perhaps hard-coded into your codebase or supplied by the user directly.\n\nConsider the case where you've built a chat product and your end user wants to expose a \"Send Slack Message\" action to your product. Their action setup [might look like this](https://cdn.zappy.app/d19215e5a2fb3896f6cddf435dfcbe27.png).\n\nThe user only has to pick Slack and authorize their Slack account. By default, all required fields are set to \"Have AI guess\". In this example there are two required fields: Channel and Message Text.\n\nIf a field uses \"Have AI guess\", two things happen:\n1. When the action is run via the API, NLA will interpret passed `instructions` (using a language model) to fill in the values for Channel and Message Text. NLA is smart about fields like Channel -- Slack's API requires a Channel ID, not a plain text Channel name. NLA handles all such cases automatically.\n2. The field will be listed as an optional hint parameter in the OpenAPI spec (see \"hint parameters\" below) which allows you (the developer) to override any `instructions` guessing.\n\nSometimes language models hallucinate or guess wrong. And if this were a particuarly sensitive Slack message, the user may not want to leave the selection of \"Channel\" up to chance. NLA allows the user [to use a specific, fixed value like this](https://cdn.zappy.app/dc4976635259b4889f8412d231fb3be4.png).\n\nNow when the action executes, the Message Text will still be automatically guessed but Channel will be fixed to \"#testing\". This significantly increases user trust and unlocks use cases where the user may have partial but not full trust in an AI guessing.\n\nWe call the set of fields the user denoted \"Have AI guess\" as \"hint parameters\" -- Message Text above in the above example is one. They are *always* optional. When running actions via the API, you (the developer) can choose to supply none/any/all hint parameters. Any hint parameters provided are treated exactly like \"Use a specific value\" at the user layer -- as an override. \n\nOne aside: custom fields. Zapier supports custom fields throughout the platform. The degenerate case is a spreadsheet, where _every_ column is a custom field. This introduces complexity because sheet columns are unknowable at action setup time if the user picks \"Have AI guess\" for which spreadsheet. NLA handles such custom fields using the same pattern as above with one distinction: they are not listed as hint parameters because they are literally unknowable until run time. Also as you may expect, if the user picks a specific spreadsheet during action setup, custom fields act like regular fields and flow through normally.\n\nIn the typical chat/assistant product use case, you'll want to expose these hint parameters alongside the exposed action list to your own language model. Your language model is likely to have broader context about the user vs the narrowly constrained `instructions` string passed to the API and will result in a better guess.\n\nIn summary:\n\n```\n[user supplied \"Use specific value\"] --overrides--> [API call supplied hint parameters] --overrides--> [API call supplied \"instructions\"]\n```\n\n\n#### Common API use cases <a name=\"common-api-uses\"></a>\n\nThere are three common usages:\n1. Get a list of the current user's exposed actions\n2. Get a list of an action's optional hint parameters\n3. Execute an action\n\nLet's go through each, assuming you have a valid access token already.\n\n### 1. Get a list of the current user's exposed actions <a name=\"list-exposed-actions\"></a>\n\n```\n# via the RESTful list endpoint:\ncurl -v -H \"Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>\" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/\n\n# via the dynamic openapi.json schema:\ncurl -v -H \"Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>\" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json\n```\n\nExample of [full list endpoint response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/), snipped below:\n\n```\n{\n    \"results\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX\",\n            \"description\": \"Slack: Send Channel Message\",\n            ...\n```\n\nExample of [full openapi.json response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json), snipped below:\n\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"paths\": {\n        ...\n        \"/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/\": {\n            \"post\": {\n                \"operationId\": \"exposed_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX_execute\",\n                \"summary\": \"Slack: Send Channel Message (execute)\",\n                ...\n\n```\n\n### 2. Get a list of an action's optional hint parameters <a name=\"get-hints\"></a>\n\nAs a reminder, hint parameters are _always_ optional. By default, all parameters are filled in via guessing based on a provided `instructions` parameter. If a hint parameter is supplied in an API request along with instructions, the hint parameter will _override_ the guess.\n\n```\n# via the RESTful list endpoint:\ncurl -v -H \"Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>\" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/\n\n# via the dynamic openapi.json schema:\ncurl -v -H \"Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>\" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json\n```\n\nExample of [full list endpoint response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/), snipped below:\n\n```\n{\n    \"results\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX\",\n            \"description\": \"Slack: Send Channel Message\",\n            \"input_params\": {\n                \"instructions\": \"str\",\n                \"Message_Text\": \"str\",\n                \"Channel\": \"str\",\n                ...\n```\n\nExample of [full openapi.json response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json), snipped below:\n\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"components\": {\n        \"schemas\": {\n            ...\n            \"PreviewExecuteRequest_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX\": {\n                \"title\": \"PreviewExecuteRequest_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX\",\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"instructions\": {\n                        ...\n                    },\n                    \"Message_Text\": {\n                        ...\n                    },\n                    \"Channel_Name\": {\n                        ...\n                    }\n\n```\n\n_Note: Every list of input_params will contain `instructions`, the only required parameter for execution._ \n\n### 3. Execute (or preview) an action <a name=\"execute-action\"></a>\n\nFinally, with an action ID and any desired, optional, hint parameters in hand, we can run (execute) an action. The parameter `instructions` is the only required parameter run an action.\n\n```\ncurl -v \\\n    -d '{\"instructions\": \"send a short poem about automation and robots to slack\", \"Channel_Name\": \"#fun-zapier\"}' \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/'\n```\n\nAnother example, this time an action to retrieve data:\n\n```\ncurl -v \\\n    -d '{\"instructions\": \"grab the latest email from bryan helmig\"}' \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTA3G1WD49GN1XXXXXXXXX/execute/'\n```\n\nOne more example, this time requesting a preview of the action:\n\n```\ncurl -v \\\n    -d '{\"instructions\": \"say Hello World to #fun-zapier\", \"preview_only\": true}' \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/'\n```\n\n\n#### Execution Return Data <a name=\"return-data\"></a>\n\n##### The Status Key <a name=\"status-key\"></a>\n\nAll actions will contain a `status`. The status can be one of four values:\n\n`success`\n\nThe action executed successfully and found results.\n\n`error`\n\nThe action failed to execute. An `error` key will have its value populated.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n    {\n        ...\n        \"action_used\": \"Gmail: Send Email\",\n        \"result\": null,\n        \"status\": \"error\",\n        \"error\": \"Error from app: Required field \"subject\" (subject) is missing. Required field \"Body\" (body) is missing.\"\n    }\n```\n\n`empty`\n\nThe action executed successfully, but no results were found. This status exists to be explicit that having an empty `result` is correct.\n\n`preview`\n\nThe action is a preview and not a real execution. A `review_url` key will contain a URL to optionally execute the action from a browser,\nor just rerun without the `preview_only` input parameter.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n    {\n        ...\n        \"action_used\": \"Slack: Send Channel Message\",\n        \"input_params\": {\n            \"Channel\": \"fun-zapier\",\n            \"Message_Text\": \"Hello World\"\n        },\n        \"review_url\": \"https://nla.zapier.com/execution/01GW2E2ZNE5W07D32E41HFT5GJ/?needs_confirmation=true\",\n        \"status\": \"preview\",\n    }\n```\n\n##### The Result Key <a name=\"result-key\"></a>\n\nAll actions will return trimmed `result` data. `result` is ideal for humans and language models alike! By default, `full_results` is not included but can be useful for machines (contact us if you'd like access to full results). The trimmed version is created using some AI and heuristics:\n\n* selects for data that is plain text and human readable\n* discards machine data like IDs, headers, etc.\n* prioritizes data that is very popular on Zapier\n* reduces final result into about ~500 words\n\nTrimmed results are ideal for inserting directly back into the prompt context of a large language models without blowing up context token window limits.\n\nExample of a trimmed results payload from \"Gmail: Find Email\":\n\n```\n    {\n        \"result\": {\n            \"from__email\": \"mike@zapier.com\",\n            \"from__name\": \"Mike Knoop\",\n            \"subject\": \"Re: Getting setup\",\n            \"body_plain\": \"Hi Karla, thanks for following up. I can confirm I got access to everything! ... Thanks! Mike\",\n            \"cc__emails\": \"bryan@zapier.com, wade@zapier.com\"\n            \"to__email\": \"Mike Knoop\",\n        }\n    }\n```\n## Changelog <a name=\"changelog\"></a>\n\n**Mar 20, 2023**\nShipped two minor but breaking changes, and one other minor change to the API's response data:\n\n* Route: `/api/v1/configuration-link/`\n  * Key `url` is now `configuration_link` **(breaking change)**\n* Route: `/api/v1/exposed/{exposed_app_action_id}/execute/`\n  * Key `rating_url` is now `review_url` **(breaking change)**\n* Route: `/api/v1/exposed/`\n  * Added `configuration_link` key",

See [REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service) Environment for existing and new customers](https://community.zuora.com/t5/API/REST-endpoint-base-URL-of-Production-Copy-Service-Environment/td-p/29611) for more information. |\n|US Cloud Production | \thttps://rest.na.zuora.com |\n|US Cloud API Sandbox | \thttps://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com |\n|US Central Sandbox | \thttps://rest.test.zuora.com |    \n|EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com |\n|EU API Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com |\n|EU Central Sandbox | \thttps://rest.test.eu.zuora.com |\n\nThe Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your Zuora representative for assistance.\n\n\nIf you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href=\"https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, including a sample product catalog.\n\n# API Changelog\nYou can find the <a href=\"https://community.zuora.com/t5/Developers/API-Changelog/gpm-p/18092\" target=\"_blank\">Changelog</a> of the API Reference: Billing in the Zuora Community.\n\n# Authentication\n\n## OAuth v2.0\n\nZuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Zuora REST API. Currently, OAuth is not available in every environment. See [Zuora Testing Environments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Environments) for more information.\n\nZuora recommends you to create a dedicated API user with API write access on a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create an OAuth client for this user. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User\" target=\"_blank\">Create an API User</a> for how to do this. By creating a dedicated API user, you can control permissions of the API user without affecting other non-API users.\n\nIf a user is deactivated, all of the user's OAuth clients will be automatically deactivated.\n\nAuthenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:\n1. Create a Client\n2. Generate a Token\n3. Make Authenticated Requests\n\n### Create a Client\n\nYou must first [create an OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.\n\n**Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the \"API Write Access\" permission.\n\n### Generate a Token\n\nAfter creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) operation. This operation requires the following parameters:\n- `client_id` - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step\n- `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`\n\n**Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. You should reuse the bearer token until it is expired. When the token is expired, call [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) again to generate a new one.\n\n### Make Authenticated Requests\n\nTo authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer token in an HTTP header:\n\n`Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`\n\nIf you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Entities) enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. You can use the `scope` field in the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.\n\nIf the `scope` field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. For example, if the `scope` field contains `entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc` and `entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`, specify one of the following headers:\n- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`\n- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`\n\n**Note**: For a limited period of time, Zuora will accept the `entityId` header as an alternative to the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header. If you choose to set the `entityId` header, you must remove all \"-\" characters from the entity ID in the `scope` field.\n\nIf the `scope` field contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify an entity ID.\n\n## Other Supported Authentication Schemes\n\nZuora continues to support the following additional legacy means of authentication:\n\n  * Use username and password. Include authentication with each request in the header: \n  \n    * `apiAccessKeyId` \n    * `apiSecretAccessKey`\n    \n    Zuora recommends that you create an API user specifically for making API calls. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User\" target=\"_blank\">Create an API User</a> for more information.\n  \n  * Use an authorization cookie. The cookie authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified in  **Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout**. The cookie expiration time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain a cookie, call the [Connections](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Connections) resource with the following API user information: \n  \n    *   ID    \n    *   Password\n    \n  * For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See below for more details.\n\n### Entity Id and Entity Name\n\nThe `entityId` and `entityName` parameters are only used for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity \"Zuora Multi-entity\"). These are the legacy parameters that Zuora will only continue to support for a period of time. Zuora recommends you to use the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` parameter instead.\n\n\nThe  `entityId` and `entityName` parameters specify the Id and the [name of the entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/B_Introduction_to_Entity_and_Entity_Hierarchy#Name_and_Display_Name \"Introduction to Entity and Entity Hierarchy\") that you want to access, respectively. Note that you must have permission to access the entity. \n\nYou can specify either the `entityId` or `entityName` parameter in the authentication to access and view an entity.\n\n  * If both `entityId` and `entityName` are specified in the authentication, an error occurs. \n  * If neither `entityId` nor `entityName` is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your user account is created. \n  \n\nTo get the entity Id and entity name, you can use the GET Entities REST call. For more information, see [API User Authentication](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/A_Overview_of_Multi-entity#API_User_Authentication \"API User Authentication\").\n  \n  ### Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled APIs\n  \n  The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and  makes your payment forms look just like any other part of your website.\n  \nFor security reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses **tokens** for authentication.\n\nThe token method of authentication is only designed for use with requests that must originate from your customer's browser; **it should  not be considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication** mechanism.\n\nSee [Zuora CORS REST](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/C_REST_API/Zuora_CORS_REST \"Zuora CORS REST\") for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See  [HMAC Signatures](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POSTHMACSignature \"HMAC Signatures\") for details on the HMAC method that returns the authentication token.\n\n# Requests and Responses\n\n## Request IDs \nAs a general rule, when asked to supply a \"key\" for an account or subscription (accountKey, account-key, subscriptionKey, subscription-key), you can provide either the actual ID or  the number of the entity.\n\n## HTTP Request Body\n\nMost of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP request. \n\nThe Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other data format (e.g., XML) is supported.\n\n### Data Type\n\n([Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal values with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of `+-0-9.eE`, for example, `5`, `1.9`, `-8.469`, and `7.7e2`. Also, Zuora does not convert currencies for decimal values.\n\n## Testing a Request\n\nUse a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se \"curl\"), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com \"Postman\"), or [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com \"Advanced REST Client\"), to test the Zuora REST API.\n\nYou can test the Zuora REST API from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production tenants. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample data or test data.\n\n## Testing with Credit Cards\n\nSooner or later it will probably be necessary to test some transactions that involve credit cards. For suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live With Your Payment Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards \"C_Zuora_User_Guides/A_Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards\"\n).\n\n## Concurrent Request Limits\n\nZuora enforces tenant-level concurrent request limits. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits\" target=\"_blank\">Concurrent Request Limits</a> for more information.\n\n## Timeout Limit\n\nIf a request does not complete within 120 seconds, the request times out and Zuora returns a Gateway Timeout error.\n\n\n# Error Handling\n\nIf a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1` (except [Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.\n\nThe following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error code and message pair:\n\n```\n {\n   \"success\": false,\n   \"processId\": \"CBCFED6580B4E076\",\n   \"reasons\":  [\n     {\n      \"code\": 53100320,\n      \"message\": \"'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN\"\n     }\n    ]\n }\n```\nThe `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.\n\nThe `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing. For example, `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is specified for the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.\n\nThe error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011` indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header. \n\nWhen troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the following Zuora error code sample:\n\n<a href=\"https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg\" alt=\"Zuora Error Code Sample\"></a>\n\n\n**Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload. Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object and an unknown field. \nThe error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules described in the [Error Category Code](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Code) section. \nIn such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.\n\n\n## REST API Resource Code\n\nThe 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example, `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object. \n\nThe value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to `679999`. See [Resource Codes](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes) in the Knowledge Center for a full list of resource codes.\n\n## Error Category Code\n\nThe 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example, resource not found or missing required field. \n\nThe following table describes all error categories and the corresponding resolution:\n\n| Code    | Error category              | Description    | Resolution    |\n|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|\n| 10      | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing tenant or user permission in the response message and contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) for enablement. |\n| 11      | Authentication failed       | Authentication fails due to invalid API authentication credentials. | Ensure that a valid API credential is specified. |\n| 20      | Invalid format or value     | The request cannot be processed due to an invalid field format or value. | Check the invalid field in the error message, and ensure that the format and value of all fields you passed in are valid. |\n| 21      | Unknown field in request    | The request cannot be processed because an unknown field exists in the request body. | Check the unknown field name in the response message, and ensure that you do not include any unknown field in the request body. |\n| 22      | Missing required field      | The request cannot be processed because a required field in the request body is missing. | Check the missing field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required fields in the request body. |\n| 30      | Rule restriction            | The request cannot be processed due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. |\n| 40      | Not found                   | The specified resource cannot be found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource exists in your Zuora tenant. |\n| 45      | Unsupported request         | The requested endpoint does not support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the endpoint and method matches. |\n| 50      | Locking contention          | This request cannot be processed because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance.</p> |\n| 60      | Internal error              | The server encounters an internal error. | Contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. |\n| 70      | Request exceeded limit      | The total number of concurrent requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | <p>Resubmit the request after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits) for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy.</p> |\n| 90      | Malformed request           | The request cannot be processed due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. |\n| 99      | Integration error           | The server encounters an error when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway, tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action accordingly. |\n\n\n# Pagination\n\nWhen retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional `pageSize` query parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The maximum is `40`; larger values are treated as `40`. If this value is empty or invalid, `pageSize` typically defaults to `10`.\n\nThe default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden at the method level.\n\nIf more rows are available, the response will include a `nextPage` element, which contains a URL for requesting the next page.  If this value is not provided, no more rows are available. No \"previous page\" element is explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous call.\n\n## Array Size\n\nFor data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to 300 rows.  Thus, for instance, repeated pagination can retrieve thousands of customer accounts, but within any account an array of no more than 300 rate plans is returned.\n\n# API Versions\n\nThe Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.\n\n## Major Version\n\nThe major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Zuora only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.\n\n## Minor Version\n\nZuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it. \n\nSome fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error. \n\nIf a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.\n\nIf you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.\n\nYou only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.\n\nFor all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. \n\n### Minor Version History\n\nThe supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.\n\nThe following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.\n\n| Fields         | Minor Version      | REST Methods    | Description |\n|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|\n| invoiceCollect | 189.0 and earlier  | [Create Subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Subscription \"Create Subscription\");
